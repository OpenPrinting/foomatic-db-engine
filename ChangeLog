	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Add "export" subcommand
	  to permit generating many or all ppd files.

2020-01-31 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow non-integer numbers in the "PageSize"
	  option in PPD files. Thanks to Andreas Gruenbacher (agruenba at
	  redhat dot com) for the patch (Pull request #1).

2015-06-16 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Allow user-configurable PERLPREFIX via environment
	  variable (Bug #1294).

2014-11-14 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Foomatic doesn't provide some offered PPD
	  files. Thanks to Marek Kasik for the patch (bug #1238).

2014-08-22 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: Let missing XML files be added when to a
	  PPD with already existing XML files new "*Product:" lines get
	  added.

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/xml/to.pm: Silenced warnings about
	  uninitialized strings.

2014-03-20 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Do not interpret option default values set to
	  "0" in PPD files as no default setting defined. Thanks to Deng
	  Pang from Ricoh (DengPang at rst dot ricoh dot com) for the report.

2014-01-02 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-addpjloptions.in: Make foomatic-addpjloptions work with
	  the system's Foomatic database, too.

2013-03-11 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Error out when initializing the DB object
	  without any form of a Foomatic database being present, made
	  the getpage() method a normal, object-independent function as
	  it does not need a Foomatic database.

	* foomatic-configure.in, foomatic-printjob.in: Updated to use
	  getpage() as a normal function, fixed CUPS check, made
	  foomatic-printjob working without presence of a Foomatic
	  database.

2012-02-15 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/sql/from.pm: Finished support for
	  pulling options from the sql database.

	* ChangeLog: Fixed spacing in last five commit comments.

2012-02-14 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/sql/from.pm: Added support
	  for the option_choice_translation and
	  options_translation table. Refactored existing code.

2012-02-09 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/sql/from.pm: Added support
	  for the option_choice table.

2012-02-05 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/xml/to.pm, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Moved xml generation functionality to filter.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Typo fix.

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/xml/to.pm: Fixed indentation.

2012-01-30 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/sql/from.pm: Added initial pull_option()
	  loop. So far only pulls basic data from the sql db.

	* lib/Foomatic/filters/sql/to.pm: Fixed bug where style
	  was not getting set if the style was "forced_composite"
	  Removed redundent commit that sqlite was complaing about.

	* lib/Fooamtic/DB.pm: Cleaned up get_driver(), get_option(),
	  and get_printer() unifying them with a control flow with
	  early returns.

2012-01-07 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/(sqlLayer.pm|xmlParse.pm|phonebook.pm):
	  Subdivided these into categories under 
	  lib/Foomatic/filters/*/ thus reducing clutter. I'm working on
	  refactoring (or at least moving arround) to get DB.pm down to
	  a managable size.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-xml-to-sqlite.in:
	  Changed refernces to the above files to match their new homes.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Removed killing of childern threads. 
	  This speeds up generating the ppd db by letting the cache fill
	  with drivers and options.
	  Achived a complete ppd build in ~4 minutes using a child worker
	  thread for each core of my early 2009 quad core amd.
	  Should be noted that the c xml parers had no caching so this
	  speed up does not work in 4 series foomatic.

2012-01-06 Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed typo in get_combo_data_from_sql_db()
	  method.

2012-01-06 Jeff Licquia <licquia@linuxfoundation.org>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Optimized regexps in the normalize() function
	  and removed unneeded calls of normalize(), vastly improving speed
	  of printer search operations, as they are done for queries via
	  the web query API on the OpenPrinting web server.

2011-12-23 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-test-build.in: finished this test script.
	  The script has already helped, turns out I had a error
	  in my standard build process that meant I wasn't
	  actaully building the new sources. I whiched foomatic-
	  test-build to use the standard perl option parsing
	  functions.

2011-12-17 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* unit-test/: I'm reverting my addition of this folder.
	  I do not want to mess with the build script. Maybe
	  sometime when I am more familiar with the scripts I'll
	  feel safe adding a new directory.

	* foomatic-test-build.ln: added work in progress automated
	  build script. Will make the write&test process faster.

	* configure.ac, Makefile.in: Reflected file moves. Moved
	  the scripts I wrote into the admin scripts section.

2011-12-11 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: I missed a configuration change in last commit.
	  The verify xml script did not have its location changed in 
	  configure.ac. Apologies to Yuji Saito who caught my mistake.

2011-12-10 Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* ./unit-tests/: Added a unit test directory. In preparation for
	  get_option() I want to bring the unit tests I wrote over the summer
	  into mainline. get_option() will of course require another unit test.

	* foomatic-verify-xml.in: Moved into ./unit-tests/.

2011-08-15  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Removed debug code, added note about get_option missing support
	  for sql backend.

2011-08-15  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* phonebook.pm: Added elements for sql support, added sql schema

	* sqlLayer.pm: Initial commit from dev branch: 
	  https://launchpad.net/gsoc2011danieldressler/sqllayer 
	  Handles the brunt work of sqlite exportation.

	* foomatic-xml-to-sqlite: Initial commit from dev branch

2011-08-12  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Fixed a regression introduced in my last patch. Fixed handling of
	  pjl options in nopjl drivers. DB.pm with sqlite backend now produces the
	  same ppds are xlmParse backend.  

2011-08-12  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Fixed typo in last commit, mixed much older typo in
	  get_combo_from_sql() that was causing a printer's margins to be duplicated
	  as combo margins.
	  
	* DB.pm: Added useing a printer's dpi if it is lower than the driver's
	  default to the sql code path. Fixed typo in sql. Noxml printers now
	  default to colour=true, this matches the behaviour of the C programs which
	  if how xmlParse does things. Fixed driver nopjl option by properly
	  prefixing the key with 'driver'.

2011-08-11  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Working code path for generating ppds from sqlite backend.
	  Required altering several sql to avoid mysql specific behaviour.
	  Removed use of if() function replaced with sql cases, split multistatement
	  Drop table calls into single statement calls.

2011-08-09  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: working creation of overview with sqlite backend. Made three
	  openprinting website specific functions no-op for none mysql dbs.
	  Removed order by binary() from two sql statements.
	
2011-08-08  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Added creation of sqlite database handle.
	
	* DB.pm: Fixed typos in my last commit.

2011-07-29  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: Fixed a typo in get_driver(), added the function get_option(),
	  and made the primary get_*() functions take an optional version argument.
	  Version argument then gets passed to xmlParse, defaults to 0, which is
	  compatability with the C programs.

2011-07-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Removed unneeded creation of the overview
	  if foomatic-ppdfile is called with a printer for which there is no
	  XML file. Formerly, as printer/driver pairs with a printer without
	  XML entry were not valid, the use of a non-listed printer was
	  assumed to be a typo and a case-insensitive search in the database
	  was done. Now an invalid printer input leads to an error message
	  when requesting the combo, which is much faster, both for getting
	  a PPD for a non-listed valid printer and an error message for an
	  invalid printer.

	* lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm: Delete also the "printers_byname" fields
	  in clones of driver entries during the overview. Otherwise it comes
	  to memory explosions if only a few big driver entries get added to
	  the database. Now scalability seems to work well.

2011-07-20  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* xmlParse.pm: noXml printers now default to color == true.

2011-07-20  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* DB.pm: now uses xmlParse version 2 for combos

	* phonebook.pm: comboppdentry and cmd_pdf are now copied for
	  combos.

	* xmlParse.pm: renamed cleanID to getCleanId. renamed
	  generalGroups to setGeneralGroups. Fixed getDriverPrinter().
	  Fixed two typos in  getPrinterSpecificDriver(). Brought noXml
	  printer data generation into own function. Fixed isPairSupported
	  now works if only one xml contains printer/driver entries.
	  Added getXmlPath() which supports getting the paths for xmls
	  in the library path and in the working directory.
	  Brought driver and printer caching into its own function, used
	  by parseCombo. Provided the xmlParse object stays alive combo
	  generation will be cpu bound. Added support in parseCombo for
	  noXml printers.

2011-07-20  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* xmlParse.pm: Changed default combo data to use more
	  rebust user detection. Added support for ppdentry in
	  driver's list of printers. Made this ppdentry get included
	  in combos under the key comboppentry.

	* phonebook.pm: Add the obsolete key to the list of keys 
	  copied from driver data to combos.

	* DB.pm: put back generalentries() I removed had removed it
	  thinking that it was obsolete. Also changed get_combo_data
	  to use the new error logging key.

2011-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm: Fixed the "extended overview" CUPS
	  overview mode. It did not set the $printer->{'drivers'} keys.

2011-07-19  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Renamed "skipPPDs" to cupsMode.

	* Addded "extended overview" to parseOverview, when cupsMode == 2
	  pairs with ppd specific ppds are not skipped.

2011-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm: When reading references to printer IDs
	  in driver and option XML files, always apply the
	  translate_printer_id() function from DB.pm, as in foomatic-db
	  there are still some old references which were forgotten to be
	  updated (bug).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Optimized translate_printer_id() by caching
	  the translation table in memory instead of reading it again on every
	  call.

	* lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm: Added some comments which work around a bug
	  in the syntax highlighting of emacs, so that the file appears
	  correctly highlighted and therefore more readable in emacs.

2011-07-18  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Fixed xmlParse's parseOverview not skipping drivers with no
	  command line or pdf command line.

2011-07-18  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Fixed xmlParse attempting to use driver->{'id'} in stead of
	  driver->{'name'} in isPairSupported() and parseCombo()'s error log

2011-07-17  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Added printer_byname key to driver data structure for fast lookup,
	  only version 2 and better

	* parseCombo() now caches the drivers. This speeds up bulk ppd
	  generation.

	* getPrinterSpecificDriver() now only clones when needed,
	  saving ~9 seconds off an overview

	* 'log' keys now exist in DB and xmlParse objects,
	  errors get logged there.

	* parseCombo() now checks that the driver/printer pair is supported.

	* skipIfXml argument added to get_drivers_for_printer(), ppdfile uses it
	  to avoid a overview generation, possible because parseCombo will
	  now error if a pair is unsupported.

	* Fixed parseOverview not adding a driver to a printer's list of
	  supported drivers during driver driven combination.

2011-07-15  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Fixed get_overview(), I had double quotes arround a glob
	  I thought they were option =<. Removed on disk caching of overview
	  code. This code was already no-op'd and obsolete due to an
	  in memory cache.

	* Fix in get_combo_data(), I was using the default driver instead of the
	  one passed as an argument.

2011-07-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.1.in, foomatic-combo-xml.c,
	  foomatic-fix-xml.in.  foomatic-perl-data.1.in,
	  foomatic-perl-data.c, README, USAGE, Makefile.in, configure.ac:
	  Removed the C accelerators foomatic-combo-xml and
	  foomatic-perl-data. With Daniel Dressler's new code they are not
	  needed any more. Also removed foomatic-fix-xml which is a
	  workaround for a bug in libxml1. libxml1 is not supported any more
	  since the removal of the C accelerators.

2011-07-15  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* get_combo_data() now uses xmlParse. Removed some debug code
	  from xmlParse

2011-07-14  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* Fixed imports in lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm,
	  lib/Foomatic/phonebook.pm. DB::get_printer, DB::get_driver,
	  and DB::get_overview now use the perl xmlParse.

	* Replaced body of get_combo_data_xml and get_overview_xml with an error
	  that the function is deprecated.

	* getdat has been renamed to get_combo_data, getdat is now a stub
	  for its new name.

2011-07-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-verify-xml.pl, foomatic-verify-xml.in, Makefile.in,
	  configure.ac: Integrated foomatic-verify-xml into the build system.
	  Some text clean-up.

2011-07-09  Daniel Dressler <danieru.dressler@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, lib/Foomatic/xmlParse.pm,
	  lib/Foomatic/phonebook.pm: Added new code for parsing the XML
	  database without helper programs written in C.

	* Added foomatic-verify-xml.pl, a helper script for verifying
	  the xml database against our xml schemas using xmlint

2011-06-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: Improved printer entry searh algorithm
	  (find_printer() method) in two points:
	   1. Score match of only make and model in printer ID of the entry
	      higher than match of make and model fields of the entry but
	      lower than match of full printer ID. This raises the relevance
	      of printer ID matches if the search term contains only a partial
	      device ID consisting of only the make and model fields.
	   2. Score a printer entry with an actual printer XML file 1 point
	      higher than an implicit printer entry only coming from a
	      printer name in a driver's printer list. This raises the
	      relevance of actual printer XML entries.

2011-03-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: Handle non-UTF-8 encodings in imported PPD
	  files. Thanks to Richard Hughes (hughsient at gmail dot com) for
	  supplying me this patch from Red Hat.

	* configure.ac: Added libdir support for the ./configure
	  script. Thanks to Richard Hughes (hughsient at gmail dot com) for
	  supplying me this patch from Red Hat.

2011-01-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved code of the _get_xml_filelist()
	  function: This avoids repeated construction of the "names-$dir"
	  string and a crash of Perl if the directory does not contain any
	  XML file (bug #613). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at
	  stegny dot 2a dot pl) for the report.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed wrong quotes in error message which
	  prevented a variable from being substituted by its value (bug
	  #612). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a
	  dot pl) for the report.

	* README: Fixed typos (bug #608). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton
	  (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a dot pl) for the report.

	* Makefile.in: Silenced warning about datarootdir when running
	  "./configure".

	* configure.ac: Replaced deprecated AC_OUTPUT with argumenmts by
	  the correct usage (bug #611). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton
	  (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a dot pl) for the hint.

	* configure.ac: Converted many "dnl" comments into "#" comments so
	  that they make it into the "./configure" script (bug #610). Thanks
	  to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a dot pl) for
	  the hint.

	* configure.ac: Make choosing the install directory for Perl libraries
	  really working. The code which was commented out was not working.
	  Now bug #605 is really fixed.

2011-01-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac, acinclude.m4: Avoid name space conflicts by letting
	  the names of our own macros start with "FM_" and not with "AC_"
	  (bug #609). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at stegny
	  dot 2a dot pl) for the report.

	* configure.ac: Allow choosing the install directory for the
	  Perl library DB.pm (perl, site, vendor). Requires autoconf 2.52
	  or newer (checked with "AC_PREREQ([2.52])"). Bug #605. Thanks
	  to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a dot pl) for
	  the report.

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Eliminated compiler warnings by consistent
	  use of "const" with xmlChar and char variables (bug #604). Thanks
	  to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at stegny dot 2a dot pl) for
	  the patch.

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Improved readability of the code by using
	  symbolic constants and additional comments. Also eliminated
	  warnings about value-less "return"s and unused variables (bug
	  #599, #600, #601). Thanks to Christopher Yeleighton (giecrilj at
	  stegny dot 2a dot pl) for the patch.

2010-12-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Documented special entities for inserting job parameters,
	  like "&job;", "&user;", "&host;", "&title;", "&options;", ...

2010-12-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: Allow generating a printer XML files also
	  from more than one PPD file for the same printer with only one call
	  of the foomatic-ppd-to-xml script. Feature request from George Liu
	  from Ricoh (bug #565).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow loading arbitrary printer and driver
	  XML files into the Perl data structure, not only XML files which
	  are in the current XML database.
	  When generating Perl data from a PPD do not add a new paragraph to
	  the printer comments if the added comment is empty.

2010-12-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.in: Rearranged gcc command line so that linking works
	  with gcc 4.5.x (Ubuntu bug #687973).

2010-12-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Sort the driver lists in printer XML files
	  alphabetically (case-insensitive) when generating XML files from
	  a Perl data structure, so that the files are identical to the
	  MySQL -> XML exporter on the OpenPrinting web servers. This
	  prevents automatic BZR commits into foomatic-db or
	  foomatic-db-nonfree which contain nothing more than driver list
	  reordering.

	* README, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, ppdtoxml: Use always a single space
	  before the closing "/>" of body-less tags. This way the XML style
	  of files committed to the BZR repositories of foomatic-db and
	  foomatic-db-nonfree is the same as the XML style used by the
	  export of XML from the MySQL database on the OpenPrinting web
	  server and so the daily synchronization does not commit pure
	  XML style changes into the BZR repositories.

2010-11-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: Added new features to
	  foomatic-ppd-to-xml: Now custom comments can be added (-c), the
	  deafult comments can get suppressed (-C), and XML files with only
	  te drivers requested with -r and -d can be generated (-D).

2010-08-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Do not die if the C helper programs
	  foomatic-combo-xml and foomatic-perl-data fail. Simply return
	  undef so that the caller can handle the error.

2010-08-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Fixed bug that made the PPD URI
	  foomatic:Apollo-P-2100-hpijs-pcl3.ppd interpreted as printer
	  Apollo-P-2100-hpijs and driver pcl3.

2010-07-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for the new
	  "fingerprint" parameter of the <package> tag.

2010-07-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Documented new "fingerprint" parameter for the <package>
	  tag. It provides a link to key fingerprint on the web site of the
	  issuer of the driver.

2010-06-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-compiledb.1.in, foomatic-kitload.8.in: Fixed some
	  hyphen-used-as-minus lintian warnings. Thanks to Didier Raboud
	  (didier at raboud dot com) for the patch.

2010-06-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.in: Do "make install" in lib/ directory with explicit
	  use of DESTDIR. Otherwise it can come to a duplicate insertion
	  of DESTDIR. Thanks to Tim Mooney for the patch (Bug #445).

	* configure.ac: Simplified and generalized the check for the Perl
	  library directory prefix in the configure script. Thanks to Tim
	  Mooney (Bug #418).

	* configure.ac: Check for functions of libxml with CFLAGS and LIBS
	  containing the detected references to libxml. Thanks to Tim Mooney
	  for the patch (Bug #444).

2010-04-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: "*FoomaticRIPNoPageAccounting" was not inserted
	  into the generated Foomatic PPDs when the printer/driver data was
	  read from a MySQL database. Fixed.

2010-04-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Implemented two acceleration modes to the
	  overview request from the MySQL database
	  get_overview_from_sql_db(): $speedmode = 0: Full overview;
	  $speedmode = 1: Do not query auxiliary tables of the driver
	  entries; $speedmode = 2: Do not query driver entries at
	  all (former $nodrivers = 1). This is needed for the OpenPrinting
	  web server. The web query interface uses the printer search
	  find_printer() and this printer search requests an overview which
	  needs to be accelerated to obtain reasonable response
	  times. Before, we did not read driver entries, but as we nowadays
	  allow to define a printer by only listing it in a driver entry, we
	  must read driver entries to find all printers. So we accelerate by
	  simply not reading auxiliary tables but only the printer and
	  driver list tables.

2010-03-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: apply_driver_and_pdl_info(): Do not add
	  "lj5mono" to the list of suitable drivers any more, this driver
	  entry was removed from the OpenPrinting database.

2010-02-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-printermap-to-gutenprint-xml.in: Adjusted indenting of the
	  generated XML code to match the indenting of the XML code exported
	  from the MySQL database on the OpenPrinting web server.

2010-02-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Corrected PPD keyword: It must read
	  "*FoomaticRIPNoPageAccounting" and not "*FoomaticNoPageAccounting".

2010-02-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Mirrored changes from foomatic-db: <packages> tags are
	  now required for driver XML files where binary driver packages are
	  provided on the OpenPrinting web server.

2010-01-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Do not check whether there is a printer
	  database entry for a given printer/driver combo, we can generate
	  PPDs also without printer entry.

2010-01-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-ppdfile.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Made Foomatic generating Foomatic PPD files if there is no
	  printer XML file for the given printer/driver combo (but the
	  printer listed as supported in the driver XML) and made Foomatic
	  also returning ready-made PPDs if the driver XML file for the
	  combo does not exist (driver name mentioned only in the list of
	  supporting drivers in the printer XML file).

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Fixed bug of "list" output never including
	  entries for ready-made PPDs, even if this is selected in
	  /etc/cups/foomatic.conf.

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Fixed bug of a driver without <prototype>
	  tags at all (not only empty but existing <prototype> tags) being
	  considered as producing Foomatic PPDs. Such driver entries came up
	  after importing the whole Foomatic DB into MySQL and exporting it
	  back to XML.

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: If an overview is
	  requested but only with PPD-producing printer/driver combos and
	  without ready-made PPDs, combos with both a command line prototype
	  in their driver XML and a PPD link in their printer XML got
	  displayed. As Foomatic returns the ready-made PPD in such a case
	  and not the Foomatic PPDs these entries get suppressed now.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: When using an SQL database the selection
	  whether only PPD-producing combos get shown and whether
	  ready-made PPDs should be included works correctly now.

2009-12-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Mirrored changes from the README file of foomatic-db.

2009-12-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: If the PPD file
	  supplied to foomatic-ppd-to-xml is compressed and should be
	  linked in the generated printer XML file, assume that it gets
	  added to the OpenPrinting database uncompressed. Therefore
	  remove the ".gz" extension from the link.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: If a PPD file supplied to the ppdtoperl()
	  function contains information about the page description
	  languages in the device ID or a Foomatic driver ID, use this
	  information for the generated printer data structure.

2009-12-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: Allow supplying a
	  PPD file to foomatic-ppd-to-xml which is not installed into the
	  Foomatic database tree (then the standard location
	  db/source/PPD/<make>/<PPD filename> is assumed for a PPD file
	  link in the printer XML file). Added the "-x" option to
	  foomatic-ppd-to-xml whichj lets printer XMLs be generated from
	  the PPD without checking whether the appropriate printers
	  already exist.

2009-11-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixes on printer/driver combo data readout
	  from the SQL database: Option constraint senses were read as
	  boolean type but they are actually strings containing "true" and
	  "false"; For the choices the constraints with the highest score
	  were not correctly selected; Reading of options stopped when
	  the choice list got completely read, so if boolean or numerical
	  options (they have no choices) are in the end of the option
	  list, they got not considered. This broke many Foomatic PPDs,
	  especially the ones for the "eplaser" and "eplaser-jp"
	  drivers. Thanks to Hidenori Ishii from Avasys for finding this.

2009-11-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Do not add "ev/" to IDs of option default
	  values from the MySQL database, we create the default value
	  entries already with "ev/" now to distinguish them from
	  string/password option defaults.

2009-11-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for separate comments from the
	  printer entry and from the driver entry in the driver_printer_assoc
	  table.

2009-10-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added a "quick overview mode" generating a
	  list of printer entries without driver info to the
	  get_overview_from_sql_db() function. This mode is 10-20 times
	  faster than the full overview taken from the MySQL database.
	  Made the find_printer() function way faster when using a
	  MySQL database and so the server load from driver queries by
	  printer setup tools gets reduced a lot.

2009-10-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README: Updated the README file for all recent changes and
	  additions in the XML data format of the Foomatic database.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Set "*ColorDevice:" in the Foomatic PPD
	  files not only based on whether the printer is a color printer
	  but also on whether the driver is capable of generating color
	  output (if appropriate information about the driver is
	  available).

2009-10-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for internationalization by
	  querying the translation tables of the MySQL database.

2009-09-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let an SQL-based driver query also show the
	  list of supported printers and a printer query also the list of
	  suitable drivers, as the XML-based queries do.

2009-09-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added methods make_exists_in_sql_db(),
	  printer_exists_in_sql_db(), driver_exists_in_sql_db(),
	  make_exists(), and driver_exists().

	  Added support for additional MySQL database fields in the driver
	  entries: group, locale, licenselink. Added also support for the
	  additional MySQL table for dependencies between drivers.

2009-09-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: When generating a PPD file, do only generate
	  the overview if really needed. This makes generating PPDs 10 times
	  faster whenusing a MySQL database.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Completed get_combo_data_from_sql_db()
	  method. Now PPDs can be generated based on an SQL database.
	  Added new methods get_makes_from_sql_db(),
	  get_models_by_make_from_sql_db(),
	  get_printer_from_make_model_from_sql_db().

2009-09-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed line 

	  *cupsFilter:   "application/vnd.apple-pdf 25 foomatic-rip"

	  from the Foomatic-generated PPD files, it causes problems with
	  some printers on Mac OS X (bug #386, removes enhancement of bug 
	  #313).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Started work on get_combo_data_from_sql_db().
	  For now it collects the printer and driver info but not yet the
	  option data.

2009-09-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added more methods for using an SQL database:
	  printer_exists_in_sql_db(), get_printers_for_driver_from_sql_db(),
	  get_drivers_for_printer_from_sql_db(), get_margins_from_sql_db(),
	  get_driver_packages_from_sql_db
	  Let overview and driver listing also include links to downloadable
	  packages and info about unprintable margins.
	  Do not create unneeded empty fields in the Perl data structures
	  when reading data sets from the SQL database.

2009-09-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added more methods for using an SQL database:
	  get_driverlist_from_sql_db(), get_printerlist_from_sql_db(),
	  get_printer_from_sql_db(), get_driver_from_sql_db(),
	  get_driver_support_contacts_from_sql_db().
	  Added helper function get_make_model_from_id().

2009-09-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added first methods for getting the data
	  from an SQL database instead of from an XML database:
	  connect_to_mysql_db(), disconnect_from_sql_db(),
	  get_overview_from_sql_db(), and helper function
	  read_conf_file(). It is checked whether valid database access
	  data is in the file mysql.conf in the default configuration
	  directory, and if so, the MySQL database is used.
	  Added also a DESTROY() method for Foomatic::DB which closes the
	  connection to the SQL database if one was used.

2009-08-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: Added "-n" option to the foomatic-ppd-to-xml
	  utility. This makes only new printer XML files being generated and
	  no modified versions of existing files.

2009-08-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: The "hpijs" driver entry got replaced
	  by "hplip".

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Add "hpijs-pcl5e" or "hpijs-pcl5c" or "hplip"
	  instead of "hpijs" to the driver list of the XML file of a PCL 5c/e
	  printer if a printer XML file is generated from a PPD file.

	  Fixed ppd1284DeviceID() function, it did not recognize the
	  "CMD"/"COMMAND SET" field in the device ID string.

	  Made sure that the fields in the IEEE-1284 device ID get closed with
	  a semicolon before adding a new field.

	  If there is a <ppdentry> XML tag for the printer/driver combo, do not
	  use the <ppdentry> XML tags for the printer or the driver.

	  Add "*PSVersion:" keywords for the newest Ghostscript versions to the
	  PPD files.

2009-07-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for multiple "*Product:" lines
	  in PPD files, improved determination of the model name from the
	  PPD file, put generation of the Foomatic ID from make and model
	  into the function generatepid().
	  
	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in: For determining whether there is already
	  a Foomatic entry for the given PPD, use also all "*Product:"
	  lines in the PPD and the PPD links in the XML files in the
	  OpenPrinting database. Let more than one printer XML file get
	  created if the PPD has multiple "*Product:" lines. General
	  support for multiple printer XMLs for one PPD file. Warn if the
	  "-l" command line switch is used if "-d" is not supplied.
	
2009-06-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: At some points "==" was used to compare strings,
	  it must be "eq". Especially this broke the PPD generation for all
	  boolean command-line-style options (bug #356).

2009-05-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: If a printer XML entry has a driver in its
	  driver list but for which there is no driver XML entry, this
	  printer/driver combo was considered as producing a PPD because the
	  driver is not in the list of drivers without command line
	  prototype. Replaced the negative list of drivers without command
	  line prototype by a positive list of drivers with command
	  line prototype. Now non-existing driver XML files are handled
	  correctly as drivers not producing PPDs (Ubuntu bug #373371).

2009-05-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: If a JCL option is member of a composite option
	  it was generated incorrectly in the PPD files (Ubuntu bug #361772).

2009-04-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README, USAGE, configure.ac: Set version number to 4.1.0, to be
	  always newer than the stable branch.

2009-03-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Fixed copy-and-paste bug in foomatic-compiledb
	  which broke the "-d" option (bug #319).

2009-02-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added "application/vnd.apple-pdf" as input
	  mime type to the generated Foomatic PPDs, so that also under Mac
	  OS X a full PDF printing workflow will get established (bug
	  #313).

2009-01-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: For string and password options the
	  "*ParamCustom..." keywords were not generated correctly (option
	  type missing, bug #297).
	  Changed the way how the driver's short description is added to the
	  PPD so that it can be longer than 80 characters (bug #296).

2009-01-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* Tagged branch for release 4.0.0.

2009-01-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: "foomatic-ppdfile list" showed wrong PPD
	  file names for some printers (bug #281).

2009-01-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* configure.ac: Bumped version number to 4.0.0.

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: All printers with <postscript> in their
	  <lang> sections got listed as supported by the "Postscript"
	  driver. Now explicit assignment of this driver via the
	  <printers> section in the driver entry or the <drivers> section
	  in the printer entry is required.
	  Let the overview for listing only printer/driver combos with
	  valid PPDs (foomatic-combo-xml -C") also show combos where the
	  driver is only mentioned in the printer's driver list. Now
	  foomatic-compiledb really generates all PPDs which are available
	  on the OpenPrinting web site (bug #291).

	* README, USAGE, TODO: Updated for version 4.0.0.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved printer search. Now searches with model
	  number but without product line name also work (ex: "Ricoh MPC3500"
	  finds the "Ricoh Aficio MP C3500").

	* debian/: Removed. The Debian package maintainer does not maintain
	  the debian directory in this BZR repository.

	* foomatic-filters-ppds-README, foomatic-filters-ppds-install,
	  README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds, Makefile.in: Removed build
	  of the foomatic-filters-ppds package, as foomatic-rip is now
	  written in C and so no universal platform-independent tarball of
	  this type can be created any more.

2008-11-11  Lars Uebernickel <larsuebernickel@gmx.de>
	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Set default section to 'JCL' when the option is
	a JCL option.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Output CUPS custom options.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Set the correct section in OrderDependency
	  (until now, AnySetup was always used)

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Insert JCL code directly for JCL options (not
	  via FoomaticRIPOptionSetting); Remove redundant FoomaticRIPOptions
	  for JCL enumerated choice options.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Surround JCL option values with @PJL...<0A> if
	  necessary. Quote prototypes of custom JCL options.

2008-11-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: If the overview XML input has no
	  <functionality> field, the functionality entry stays a NULL
	  pointer. On some systems like Solaris outputting a NULL pointer
	  with "printf()" leads to a segmentation fault (under Linux it is
	  no problem, the output will be "(null)"). Fix for bug #213.

2008-10-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Match the field headers of IEEE-1284 device
	  IDs case insensitively. Some IDs have these headers not
	  all-uppercase, like Kyocera. Fixed also that the manufacturer
	  name can creep into the "*Product:" field of the PPD when the
	  model name cannot be read from the device ID.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Bumped version number in PPD header to 4.0.0.

	* README, USAGE, configure.ac, foomatic-addpjloptions.in, 
	  foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  s/GhostScript/Ghostscript/

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Several fixes to
	  find existing XMLs and to let merging changes into existing
	  XMLs work correctly.

2008-10-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let
	  foomatic-ppd-to-xml find already existing printer entries and
	  merge the reference to the PPD file into them instead of
	  creating a new XML file. Let all XML files get created in a
	  user-specified directory.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let the perltoxml() function not put
	  hard-coded comments into printer entries.

2008-10-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Moved driver and PDL
	  magic of the XML file generation into lib/Foomatic/DB.pm.

2008-10-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppd-to-xml.in, Makefile.in, configure.ac,
	  lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added new "foomatic-ppd-to-xml" to generate
	  Foomatic XML files corresponding to a given PPD file.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved "normalizename()" function for
	  sorting printer, manufacturer, or driver lists.

2008-10-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Changed method to find all printers
	  supported by a given driver, so that printer/driver relations
	  can also be defined by a <drivers> section in the printer entry.

2008-09-06  Dafydd Crosby <dcrosby@userful.com>

	* ppdtoxml: Can now add extra drivers to XML more easily.

2008-09-03  Tim Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Fixed underquoted definitions.

2008-09-02  Tim Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Prevent busy loop when trying to shorten
	PPD nicknames like "HP OfficeJet LX
	Foomatic/gutenprint-ijs-simplified.5.0".

2008-08-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Use "Oki" instead of "Okidata" when
	  cleaning manufacturer names.

2008-08-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added on-disk cache functionality for the
	  database overview Perl structure. To activate this functionality
	  one does simply "use Foomatic::DB; my $db = new Foomatic::DB;
	  $db->{'overviewfile'} = "<filename>";". The CGI scripts of the
	  OpenPrinting web site generate overviews very frequently, so
	  this should reduce the server load a lot (merged from stable
	  branch).

	* ppdtoxml: Now adds the <drivers> tag, inserting the preferred 
	  driver automatically. The next release will allow the insertion
	  of extra driver entries (from Dafydd Crosby, merged from stable
	  branch).

2008-08-12  Lars Uebernickel <larsuebernickel@gmx.de>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: Added
	  "*FoomaticRIPCommandlinePDF" and "*cupsFilter" lines for PDF
	  printing workflow to all generated PPDs.

2008-07-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added on-disk cache functionality for the
	  database overview Perl structure. To activate this functionality
	  one does simply "use Foomatic::DB; my $db = new Foomatic::DB;
	  $db->{'overviewfile'} = "<filename>";". The CGI scripts of the
	  OpenPrinting web site generate overviews very frequently, so
	  this should reduce the server load a lot.

2008-06-25  Dafydd Crosby <dcrosby@userful.com>

	* PPDtoXML: Now adds the <drivers> tag, inserting the preferred 
	  driver automatically. The next release will allow the insertion
	  of extra driver entries.

2008-06-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Allow XML files with header lines ("<? ... ?>",
	  "<! ... >") in the beginning. Everything which is before the main
	  tag of each file ("<printer>" for printer entries, "<driver>" for
	  driver entries, and "<option>" for option entries) gets removed
	  now.

2008-06-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for output of both translated
	  and original (English) license text and for links to external
	  license text files.

2008-06-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: Skip printers without printer
	  XML entry, to avoid that empty printer XML files get generated.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Simplify the generation of the list of
	  valid printer/driver combos even more.

2008-06-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: When supplying the "-C" option (overview
	  of all printer/driver combos for which a PPD file is available),
	  do not go through the printers without printer XML
	  entries (printers only mentioned in driver XML entries) as they
	  never have a valid PPD.

	  Consider a printer/driver combo also valid if the driver is
	  "Postscript" and in the <lang> section there is a <postscript>
	  section, independent whether the printer is listed in the
	  "Postscript" driver XML file.

	  In the driver XML file only copy the XML section for selected
	  printer into the emptied driver list if the section really
	  exists.

	  If we request an overview of only the printer/driver combos
	  which provide a valid PPD file ("-C" option for
	  foomatic-combo-xml) we do not list combos which have the
	  requested driver only defined in the <drivers> section of the
	  printer XML file (printer not in the driver list of the driver
	  XML file) and no ready-made PPD file

	  Strip white space from the name of the ready-made PPD file in
	  the printer enrty.

	  Let debug output show whether the selected printer/driver combo
	  is valid.

	  Bigger buffer for pseudo driver XML file for the case that the
	  driver is confirmed by an entry in the printer XML file and
	  there is no suitable driver XML file.

	  Corrected error message for an invalid printer/driver combo. It
	  caused a segfault.

	  Do not go through the printer/driver combos where the printer is
	  only defined by an entry in the driver's printer list and no
	  printer XML file exists when we request an overview for only the
	  combos which give a PPD file ("-C"). The combos without printer
	  XML never give PPD files.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: If we request PPDs use the overview for
	  only the combos with a valid PPD ("foomatic-combo-xml -C").

	  Improved the way to find all valid combos. Use the overview
	  ("foomatic-combo-xml -C", to only get combos with PPDs) and
	  do not fork for generating the list of valid combos.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for the "WindowsANSI" encoding
	  in manufacturer-supplied PPD files.

2008-05-19  Dafydd Crosby <dcrosby@userful.com>

	* ppdtoxml: Moved to foomatic-db-engine. Now handles special 
	  characters properly, made configuration more intuitive.

2008-05-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Add "printer_exists()" function to check
	  whether a printer XML file exists for a given printer ID. The
	  "get_printer()" function is not suitable for this purpose
	  any more.

2008-05-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  If a printer is in the list of supported printers of a driver
	  XML file but there is no printer XML file for the printer,
	  behave as the printer XML was there, generating a minimalistic
	  pseudo entry. Mark the pseudo entries with the "<noxmlentry />"
	  tag to distinguish them from real or user-contributed entries.

2008-01-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added "<patents>" tag to driver entries. Drivers
	  which are free software but contain (possibly) patented algorithms
	  (like JBIG compression) should be marked with this tag to warn users
	  about the patent issues when auto-downloading the driver.

2007-12-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added "<group>" tag to driver entries. Drivers
	  which differ only by their locales ("<locales>" tag) should have the
	  same "<group>" tags. If the user queries a driver giving a locale
	  he gets only the best matching from each group.

2007-12-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow localized queries by adding a "language"
	  field to the data structure and calling foomatic-perl-data with
	  an appropriate "-l" option.

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Fixed "-l" option, with "-l" the debug mode
	  was always activated.

2007-12-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added new XML tags "<licensetext>" (full
	  text of the license), "<locales>" (locales for which this driver
	  is recommended), "<requires>" (drivers which are required to be
	  on the system to run this driver), and "<packages>" (explicit
	  listing of downloadable package files). They were introduced to
	  fulfill demands of the printer manufacturers.

	  Allow internationalization in the "<license>", "<supplier>", and
	  "<supportcontact>" fields.

	  Fixed internationalization. Now it is at first tried to find a
	  text version which matches the user-supplied locale ID exactly,
	  then it is searched for a text version where the supplied locale
	  ID matches at least the language (First two characters), and as
	  last mean english text is shown.
	
2007-10-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: The PPD gnerator for CUPS did not list the
	  PPDs correctly on printer names containing a comma (Ubuntu bug
	  #150985).

2007-08-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let margins default to safer values (1/4
	  inch on the left and on the right, 1/2 inch at the top and the
	  bottom) if no margins are defined in the Foomatic database.
	  Before, the default margins were all zero.

	  Allow an empty model name in the search term for the
	  find_printer() function ("ricoh|"), This way one can also search
	  all printers from a given manufacturer, where the given
	  manufacturer name does not need to match exactly with the name
	  in the database.

	  Some improvements in cleaning the manufacturer names.

	  Improvements in the perltoxml() function.

2007-07-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README, foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support
	  for suppressing page accounting on a per-driver basis. If a
	  driver XML file is marked with "<nopageaccounting/>" in its
	  "<execution>" section, the line "*FoomaticNoPageAccounting:
	  True" is added to the PPD file to let foomatic-rip suppress
	  inserting the page accounting code into the PostScript data
	  stream.

2007-07-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* Makefile.in, README, README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds, USAGE,
	  configure.ac, foomatic-preferred-driver.in,
	  foomatic-printermap-to-gimp-print-xml.in,
	  foomatic-printermap-to-gutenprint-xml.in, debian/presubj,
	  lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Replaced "Gimp-Print" by "Gutenprint".

2007-07-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow group names preceeded by asterisks
	  ('*') in PPD files ("*OpenGroup: ..."/"*CloseGroup: ..." lines).
	  This is needed by the PPD for the KONICA MINOLTA magicolor 5430
	  DL, provided by KONICA MINOLTA and probably also by several
	  other manufacturer-supplied PPD files.

2007-03-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Let the PPD files listed in the XML version
	  of the overview also get listed in the Perl version.

2007-03-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved find_printer() method. Now
	  searches of make and model names do not consider other characters
	  than letters and numbers any more. All other characters are and
	  boundaries between letters and numbers are converted to single
	  spaces.

2007-03-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* debian/control: "gimp-print" -> "gutenprint".

2007-02-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added new find_printer() method, to find
	  printer entries in the database based on IEEE-1284 device IDs
	  (from printer auto-detection), make/model, make, or model.
	  This is for a new search function on the site and also for
	  finding driver packages by printer setup tools.

	* foomatic-searchprinter.in, configure.ac, Makefile.in: Added
	  simple tool to find printers in the locally installed
	  Foomatic database using the new find_printer() method.

2007-02-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let "<obsolete>" tags
	  in driver XML files be read and added to the Perl data structures
	  of driver entries, printer/driver combos, and the overview. Let
	  this info also be put into the PPDs and into the "DRV:" field
	  of the device IDs.

2007-02-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Let Perl data structure for driver XML
	  files also contain the printer-specific exceptions of the driver
	  functionality data.

2007-02-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow specifying
	  manufacturer names along with the "<manufacturersupplied>" tag
	  in the driver XML file. In this case in the PPDs and in the PPD
	  lists the driver is only marked as supplied by the manufacturer
	  if the printer manufacturer's name matches one of the given
	  names. For example if a Brother printer is used with HPIJS, the
	  driver is not considered manufacturer-suppiled.

2007-02-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: 
	  Let new driver data fields go into the generated PPD files and
	  into the oberview output. To get this information into the PPD
	  lists of CUPS 1.2.x when using on-the-fly PPD generation added
	  a new "DRV:" field to the device ID which contains all the
	  driver functionality information.

2007-02-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for
	  new data fields in the driver XML files. These data fields
	  should describe the properties of the drivers in a better way to
	  guide the user to find the best driver for his personal needs
	  and also make printer setup tools clearly informing the user
	  before downloading and installing a driver which is not part of
	  the distribution.

2007-02-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* Foomatic-Devel-Ideas.txt, README, debian/README.Debian,
	  debian/control, foomatic-filters-ppds-README, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Replaced "FSG OpenPrinting" by "OpenPrinting".

2007-02-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for more driver types:
	  CUPS Raster, IJS, and OpenPrinting Vector.

2007-01-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* README, USAGE, README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds,
	  foomatic-addpjloptions.8.in, foomatic-combo-xml.1.in,
	  foomatic-compiledb.1.in, Foomatic-Devel-Ideas.txt,

	  "http://www.openprinting.org/" and "FSG OpenPrinting".

2007-01-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmail.com>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.1.in: Corrected mark-up in the man page for
	  foomatic-ppdfile (Thanks to Eric Raymond for his man page
	  verification bot).

2006-11-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-ppdfile.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Let the listing of auto-generatable PPD files for CUPS 1.2
	  ("foomatic-ppdfile list") not contain entries for combos of
	  printers with driver entries with a ready-made PPD file, as
	  these PPD files are usually listed by CUPS directly.

2006-09-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Added forgotten DESTDIR (upstream merge from Debian 
	  patch).

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Several small stability fixes in the C code
	  (upstream merge from Debian patch).

	* foomatic-configure.in: If there is a user named "cupsys", switch
	  the ownership of the PPD files to "cupsys", this way Ubuntu does
	  not break on running CUPS as non-root. This does not affect
	  other distributions (upstream merge from Debian patch).

	* foomatic-printjob.in: Added help for the printer-specific
	  options (upstream merge from Debian patch).

	* foomatic-getpjloptions.8.in: Typo fix (upstream merge from
	  Debian patch).

	* foomatic-printjob.1.in: Text fixes, new help on printer options
	  mentioned (upstream merge from Debian patch).

2006-09-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c, foomatic-ppdfile.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Let the listing of auto-generatable PPD files for CUPS 1.2
	  ("foomatic-ppdfile list") not contain entries for combos of
	  printers with driver entries which do not have a command line
	  prototype (these indicate only that the printer/driver combo
	  works, but do not produce PPD files). Allow defining valid
	  printer/driver combos also by only defining the driver in the
	  "<drivers>" section of the printer entry. So for a printer with
	  ready-made PPD it is enough to add a driver entry with link to
	  the PPD in its "<drivers>" section so that "foomatic-ppdfile"
	  lists and returns the PPD.

2006-07-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: For get_javascript2() building the printer
	  menu based on pre-read data now also printer IDs can be supplied
	  instead of deriving the IDs from the model names.

2006-07-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Fixed missing dependency at "man:" target in
	  the Makefile (Gentoo bug #138635)

2006-07-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed bug in the decoding of UI strings in
	  the PPDs, only hex-encoded characters were decoded correctly
	  (Thanks to Florian Festi from Red Hat for this patch).
	
2006-07-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-extract-text.in: Generate .po files from the UI strings
	  in the currently installed Foomatic database (Thanks to Florian
	  Festi from Red Hat for this script).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: When reading PPD files extract the UI strings
	  always in UTF-8, taking into account the encoding of the PPD file
	  (Thanks to Florian Festi from Red Hat for this patch).

	* *: Way to many files were marked executable. Fixed.

2006-06-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: get_javascript2() can now also build the
	  script based on pre-read printer data. This avoids duplicate
	  reading of the Foomatic database and allows adding of extra
	  printers which are not in the Foomatic XML database (for example
	  new user-supplied entries).

2006-05-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Eliminated a warning.

2006-05-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.ac: Do never use CUPS commands "enable-cups",
	  "disable-cups", "accept-cups", "reject-cups", even if
	  executable files with these names are available. CUPS has only
	  one executable for these tasks and recognizes by the
	  executable/link name what to do. So it only accepts execution
	  with one of the names "enable", "disable", "accept", "reject".

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: When generating PPD files from Foomatic
	  XML data and the option XML files contain "<arg_order>" tags
	  with different values, the options get ordered by the 
	  "<arg_order>" values (within their group). This way manually
	  defining the presentation order of the options gets possible.
	  Fixed also a buglet in the setting of the default of numerical
	  options.

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Removed "use strict;" due to an
	  incompatibility with the "getopts()" Perl function.

2006-05-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved group name parsing in the PPD
	  files, now the group names of the Gutenprint CUPS raster
	  PPDs are read out correctly. Do not sort the options any more
	  when reading PPD files.

2006-05-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in: Let PPD file generation with cups-driverd
	  also work if the driver name contains dashes (as in Gutenprint),
	  added "use strict;", let debug output and error messages have
	  prefixes to be correctly categorized in the CUPS error_log.

2006-04-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Added support for reading additional items
	  from the /etc/cups/printers.conf file: Print quotas, individual,
	  printer sharing, error and operation policies.

2006-04-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Eliminated some warnings

	* foomatic-configure.in: Added new URIs to URI overview in
	  header comments, let beh wrapper backend also not be
	  applied to HPLIP fax queues (URI: "hpfax:/...").

2006-04-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, configure.ac,
	  Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in, USAGE, README: Added support for
	  on-the-fly PPD file generation by the CUPS 1.2 cups-driverd.

	* USAGE: Update HPOJ -> HPLIP.

2006-02-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Treat a missing /etc/cups/printers.conf
	  as an empty file (CUPS 1.2 allows printers.conf missing for no
	  local printers). Suppress warnings if the list of available CUPS
	  queues is requested but no default printer set.

2006-01-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Generate PPD files correctly where an
	  enumerated-choice option has "0" as default (thanks to Tim
	  Waugh from Red Hat for the patch).

	* foomatic-cleanupdrivers.in: Do not try to delete the "." file in
	  the driver-XML-file directory (thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat
	  for the patch).

2006-01-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let PPD files with "*CloseGroup" without
	  group name being parsed correctly, eliminate warning about
	  uninitialized variable when a PPD file is built out of Foomatic
	  data.

2006-01-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in, configure.ac: Renamed configure.in to
	  configure.ac, to make the package working with the current
	  versions of aclocal and autoconf.

	* foomatic-cleanupdrivers.in: Delete also driver XML files
	  without "<prototype>" tags at all, as they also do not
	  contain a driver command line prototype.

2005-10-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fix on support for gzipped PPDs.

2005-10-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for gzipping the custom
	  PPD files without needing to adapt the links in the printer
	  XML files.

2005-10-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, foomatic-configure.in,
	  foomatic-ppdfile.in, foomatic-compiledb.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Let the Foomatic tools use custom-made PPD files if they are
	  linked in the printer XML file and available in the local
	  Foomatic database.

2005-09-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made "translate_printer_id()" not crashing
	  when it is called with a weird printer ID.

2005-08-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Added the links to the ready-made PPD
	  files for all drivers to the overview output. Eliminated
	  compiler warnings.

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Eliminated compiler warnings.

2005-08-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Added support for the new "beh"
	  (Backend Error Handler for CUPS) backend (included
	  in foomatic-filters now).

2005-08-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for "<ppd>" tags in the
	  "<drivers>" list of the printer XML files. This is needed
	  to provide ready-made PPDs for arbitrary drivers on the
	  linuxprinting.org site.

2005-08-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Fixed bug of multiple "tc=..." items in
	  an /etc/printcap entry of LPRng not being supported.

2005-07-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* READNE: Updated links to Adobe PostScript specifications.

2005-05-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added support for
	  PPD file names with spaces (Mandriva bug #16172).

2005-05-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README: Corrected character list in "<arg_allowedchars>" in the
	  example string option XML file. Improved instructions for
	  "<arg_allowedchars>".

2005-02-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Fixed bug of old non-Foomatic PPD not
	  overtaken when applying "foomatic-configure" to a queue without
	  specifying a PPD or a printer/driver pair.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: When modifying PPD defaults for boolean
	  options "0" or "1" was written into the PPD file and not
	  "False" or "True".

2005-01-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* makeDefaults.in, foomatic-cleanupdrivers.in: Allow use of an
	  alternative Foomatic database location specifying it with the
	  FOOMATICDB environment variable.

	* Makefile.in: Added foomatic-cleanupdrivers to be installed into 
	  /usr/sbin, fixed "testing-clean" target.

	* foomatic-cleanupdrivers.in: Use default database location from
	  Defaults.pm.

2005-01-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed Tim Waugh's fix. It made an
	  "@@IEEE1284@@" appear in the PPD file when for a printer
	  no autodetection info was supplied. This made CUPS not
	  accepting the PPD.

2005-01-21  Tim Waugh <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed "uninitialized value" warning (RH
	  bug #145605).

2004-11-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in, foomatic-ppdfile.in,

	  generate PPD files with blank "*FoomaticRIPCommandLine" entry.

2004-09-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.2. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_2".

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.2.

2004-07-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Use the manufacturer as defined in the
	  Foomatic database and not the one from the IEEE-1284
	  auto-detection ID string for the "*Manufacturer: ..." tag of the
	  PPD files, as in the IDs the manufacturer names
	  often do not comply with the Adobe specs (as "Hewlett-Packard",
	  here "HP" has to be used).

2004-07-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Replaced mechanism for auto-detecting libxml(2).

2004-07-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  Replaced "GIMP-Print" by "Gimp-Print".

2004-03-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added entries to sortargs() function to
	  support drivers with RGB processing and Gimp-Print 5.0.x support
	  for new CMYRBK (additional red and blue ink) printers.

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, foomatic-combo-xml.c: Compatibility fixes
	  for newest gcc.

2004-03-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Read paper size with unit out of the driverval
	  (needed for Omni), restrict paper sizes in the PPD to 2 digits
	  after the decimal point.

2004-02-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  Marcelo Ricardo Leitner (mrl at conectiva dot com dot br).

2004-01-22  Tim Waugh  <twaugh@redhat.com>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm (perltoxml): New function.

2003-12-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, 
	  foomatic-printermap-to-gimp-print-xml.in: Added script to
	  update the driver entry of Gimp-Print with the printer list
	  of the src/foomatic/foomatic-printermap file of the

	* Makefile.in: Make mkinstalldirs executable (Thanks to Florian
	  Diesch <diesch@spamfence.net>).

	* Makefile.in: Removed $(DESTDIR) from "make" calls for the Perl
	  libraries (Thanks to Florian Diesch <diesch@spamfence.net>).

	* Makefile.in: Use relative symlink, not absolute.

2003-11-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged all files of the repository with "foomatic-3_0-bp",
	  started stable branch "foomatic-3_0-branch".
	
2003-11-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README: Added section that CUPS raster drivers can now be used
	  with every spooler.

2003-11-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.1rc1. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_1rc1".

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.1rc1.
	
2003-11-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Do not do a test run of GhostScript in the /def/fd/3
	  check if there is no GhostScript available.

2003-10-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in: Added /usr/local/libexec to LIBSEARCHPATH for *BSD
	  compatibilty. Thanks to Sebastian Horzela (sh at horzela dot
	  com).
	
	* configure.in: Replaced a "==" by "=" in a "test" expression (*BSD
	  compatibility).

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds:
	  Fixes from Patrick Powell.

2003-09-13  Patrick Powell <papowell@lprng.com>

	* foomatic-configure:
	  set 'use strict' and perl -w options - cleaned up
	  compilation and usage errors exposed by adding these
	  options.

	  modified the LPRng setup to be consistent with the new
	  or latest version of foomatic-rip and LPRng.

	  fixed several other entries that were using values that
	  either were not initialized or were the wrong variable
	  name.  This appears to be the result of a cut-and-paste
	  where the author did not modify all of the variable names
	  in the pasted area.

	  Added warnings about security loopholes when using the
	  smbclient and nmbprint facilities.

	  Fixed up missing $DESTDIR in Makefile.in

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm
	  added 'use strict' to Foomatic::DB.pm and then did
	  editting for syntax cleanup.  Mostly adding my to
	  'for $x' loops, i.e. - 'for my $x'
	  Cleaned up a performance hit by passing reference to
	  array rather than copying array.

	* foomatic-ppdfile:
	  Added -A, -P match options to display information

	  If the PPD file does not exist, error message is printed
	  and exits with nonzero error code.  Also tidied up
	  error messages and help messages.

	  If the driver (-d driver) is not specified or is blank,
	  use the default driver for the printer.

	  Sanity check the printer and driver names against the
	  database.

	  Fixed up the foomatic-ppdfile.1 man page and added the
	  -A and -P options.

	* Makefile - make dist-clean now removes ppd subdirectory

	* configure - added check for GhostScript and security
	  loophole in GhostScript.  Modified the uses of
	  AC_PROG_PATH to avoid a problem with shell variable
	  expansion.

	* foomatic-getpjloptions:  changed use of 'echo -ne'

	* foomatic-addpjloptions now handles strings, also defaults
	  with ? characters and string values.  
	  -s   - writes options to a single file
	  -i   - does only IMPORTANT options
	  -a   - does ALL options found in PJL information
	         (except readonly)
	  -q   - reads the PJL file and produces a quick summary
               (debugging)
	       
	* man pages - fixed up several of the man pages to agree with
	  the programs.  More editting is needed.

2003-09-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed bug of the getpapersize() function
	  returning the size of "Letter" when requesting the sixe of
	  "Half Letter".

2003-08-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: When using "foomatic-configure -P -r"
	  recognize implicit classes as remotely defined printer (for
	  now this works only for root).

2003-08-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Let the information about the default
	  printer be included in the output of "foomatic-configure -P".
	  This makes the initial reading of configuration information by a
	  frontend much faster. The information will by in
	  $QUEUES[x]->{'queuedata'}{'default'}, which is 1 for the default
	  queue and 0 for the other queues. Added support for the "-r"
	  option with "foomatic-configure -P"
	  ($QUEUES[x]->{'queuedata'}{'remote'} field indicates remote
	  queues). Retrieve the "Location" information of remotely defined
	  CUPS printers.

2003-08-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed reading make and model name of the
	  printer from the PPD file to also work with the new Foomatic
	  PPDs ("*ShortNickName" linited to 32 characters and no comma
	  before the driver name).

2003-08-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Let PPD pre-compilation process not choke
	  on a driver entry with a non-existing printer (for example
	  mistyped) in its list.

2003-08-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Pre-initialized pointers in the loadidlist()
	  function (thanks to Gwenole Beauchesne from MandrakeSoft).

2003-08-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: HPOJ after 0.9 needs two slashes instead
	  of one in CUPS device URIs ("ptal://..."). Let
	  foomatic-configure do the correct thing independent whether the
	  user enters a "ptal" URI with one or two slashes.

2003-08-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-ppdfile.in, foomatic-configure.in,
	  USAGE: Added possibility to limit the length of GUI strings
	  ("translations") in the generated PPD files to 39 characters,
	  so that the CUPS PostScript driver for Windows does not choke on
	  them.
	
2003-08-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, README: Made it possible to define nested
	  composite options.

2003-07-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README, configure.in, Makefile.in, foomatic-ppdload.in,
	  foomatic-ppdload.8.in: Removed the "foomatic-ppdload" tool as
	  generating XML data from PPD files is not needed any
	  more. "foomatic-rip" works also with manufacturer-supplied
	  PostScript PPDs.
	
	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Let URL of manufacturer PPD also appear
	  in printer/driver combo output.

2003-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Fixed output of printer language info.

2003-07-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added "Folio" and "Env10" paper sizes to
	  paper size list.

2003-07-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Added stuff needed for a web form to enter
	  printer data.

2003-06-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* configure.in, makeMan.in: Support for IRIX.

2003-06-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Remove "," and "+" from the "*NickName" and
	  "*ShortNickName" to make the PostScript drivers of Windows happy,
	  fix on auto-abbreviation of "*ShortNickName".

2003-05-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README: Lots of small corrections.

2003-04-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README: Updated link to Adobe's PostScript documentation.

2003-04-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.0. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_0".

	* README, USAGE, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Updated for version 3.0.0.

2003-04-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in: Stop if an error occurs when building the PPD package.

2003-04-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-replaceoldprinterids.in: Changed default pattern on the
	  right side of the printer ID to "(?!\d)", which means that there
	  should be no further digit on the right. This is the right
	  choice in nearly every case.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Make "foomatic-compiledb" working with
	  both old numerical and new clear-text printer IDs.

2003-04-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Auto-abbreviation of "*ShortNickName"s in
	  the PPD files so that they are not longer than 31 characters to
	  fulfill the Adobe specs.

2003-04-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.0rc2. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_0rc2".

	* README, USAGE, Foomatic-Devel-Ideas.txt: Added missing
	  substitution for ampersand in XML files, updated for version
	  3.0.0rc2.
	
2003-04-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-configure.in:
	  added restriction for allowed strings by means of lists of
	  allowed characters (XML: '<arg_allowedchars>...</arg_allowedchars>',
	  PPD: '*FoomaticRIPOptionAllowedChars <option>: "..."') and Perl
	  regular expressions (XML: '<arg_allowedregexp>...
	  </arg_allowedregexp>',
	  PPD: '*FoomaticRIPOptionAllowedRegExp <option>: "..."'). The
	  allowed characters are checked by a '/^[...]*$/' expression in
	  the Perl scripts, so ranges with '-', forbidden characters with
	  a leading '^', or special characters as '\w', '\d', '\x07', ...
	  are allowed. Regular expressions are applied via a '/.../'
	  expression. These restrictions are done for security reasons, to
	  avoid for example a string like "|| rm -rf * ||" in a command line
	  option.

	  The string 'None' is always mapped to the empty string,
	  as PPD files and the command of some spoolers do not accept an
	  empty string as argument value. For the default value of a string
	  option always an enumerated choice in the PPD file is created,
	  should the string contain characters which are not allowed in
	  choice names on PPD files ir not easy to enter on the command line,
	  the offending characters are replaced by '_' in the choice name,
	  the 'driverval' will still use the original string.

	  Several bug fixes done for the string options.
	
2003-04-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.0rc1. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_0rc1".

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.0rc1.
	
	* README: Documentation for string and password options.

	* USAGE: Documentation for applying option settings only to
	  selected pages.

2003-04-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-configure.in:
	  Introduced string and password options.

2003-04-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Introduced "Forced
	  composite options", composite options where the user cannot set
	  the individual member options, but only the composite option
	  (the user is forced to use the composite option). This allows
	  options acting at two or more places, for example a "PageSize"
	  option for a driver which is a filter translating GhostScript
	  bitmap output to the printer's language. One lets one member
	  option be an option inserting PostScript code for the page size
	  into the PostScript input data stream, and another member option
	  insert the correct bitmap size into the filter's command
	  line. The user sees only the composite option and sets the paper
	  size with it as usual. In the XML database, forced composite
	  options are defined as usual composite options, only difference
	  is that in the XML entry for the composite option
	  "<arg_forced_composite>" instead of "<arg_composite>" is used.

	* README: Documented forced composite options.

2003-03-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Allow printer/driver combo XML generation
	  also when the driver or option XML files still use old numerical
	  printer IDs (important for third-party drivers).

2003-03-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-replaceoldprinterids.in: Script to replace references
	  to old numerical PostGreSQL (or otherwise obsolete) printer IDs
	  by the current ones.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Added build instructions for new
	  "foomatic-replaceoldprinterids" script.

	* README: Documentation for new "foomatic-replaceoldprinterids"
	  script.

	* USAGE: Adapted for new printer IDs, bug fix in example for PDQ,
	  raised version to 3.0.0rc1.

2003-03-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-nonumericalids.in: Script to change the old numerical
	  PostGreSQL printer IDs in the installed Foomatic database to new
	  clear-text printer IDs.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Added build instructions for new
	  "foomatic-nonumericalids" script.

	* README: Documentation for new "foomatic-nonumericalids" script,
	  raised version to 3.0.0rc1.

	* foomatic-configure.in, foomatic-ppdfile.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Added facility to translate old numerical printer IDs to the new
	  clear-text IDs.

2003-03-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 3.0.0beta2. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-3_0_0beta2".

	* README, USAGE: Updated for version 3.0.0beta2.
	
2003-03-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Fixed bug of USB device files names not
	  correctly sorted by "cups_generate_usb_device_lists()" function.
	  This cause wrong make/model-related URIs to be assigned to the
	  device files (at least with three or more connected USB
	  printers).

2003-03-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: completed support for
	  "FoomaticRIPDefault..." keywords in numerical options (see
  http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/foomatic-devel/2003q1/001250.html).

	* README: Documented "FoomaticRIPDefault..." PPD keyword.

2003-02-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: "<ppdentry>"s are now cleaned up before
	  insertion into the PPD file. Leading and trailing white space
	  is removed from every line and also leading and trailing blank
	  lines are removed.

2003-02-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: Added support for
	  "<ppdentry>" tags to add arbitrary extra lines to the PPDs,
	  added support for "<general>" and "<ieee1284>" tags in the
	  "<autodetect>" section of a printer entry, Added "*1284DeviceID"
	  keyword to generated PPDs, made disrinction between color and
	  bw printers in the generated PPD files, fixed "*ModelName"
	  to comply with PPD specs, added "FoomaticRIPDefault..." keywords
	  to numerical options (see
  http://www.linuxprinting.org/pipermail/foomatic-devel/2003q1/001250.html).
	  
2003-02-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-filters-ppds-install, foomatic-filters-ppds-README,
	  README.build-foomatic-filters-ppds, Makefile.in: Added facility
	  to build package with all PPD files and the filters.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Added permissions to "mkdir" function call,
	  so that "foomatic-compiledb" also works with Perl 5.0.x.
	
2003-02-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

2003-01-31  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed bug in the checking for missing long
	  names/translations in PPD files.

2003-01-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Fixed bug of "foomatic" flag in the Perl
	  data structure being set when the PPD is non-Foomatic.
	
2003-01-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-configure.in: Improved sorting of
	  options, make PPD parser sort the options when the PPD file is
	  non-Foomatic, Automatically fill in longnames/translations which
	  are missing in the PPD file, fixed stripping of "dossy" line
	  ends in PPD files, foomatic-configure can now also generate a
	  Perl data structure when a PPD file and not a Foomatic
	  printer/driver combo is specified on the command line, the Perl
	  output which foomatic-configure generates for Foomatic
	  printer/driver combos contains the composite options now.
	
2003-01-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* COPYING: Added file containing the GPL.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: When parsing the PPD file with the
	  "ppdtoperl()" fonts, "ImageableArea", "PaperDimension", ...  do
	  not entwr as options in the Perl data structure any more. In
	  addition, the parser puts also information about option groups
	  into the structure.

	* foomatic-configure.in: Made foomatic-configure handle
	  "usb://<make>/<model>" URIs correctly.
	
2003-01-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, configure.in,
	  Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in, USAGE: Added support for
	  compressed PPD files ("file.ppd.gz") supplied with the "--ppd"
	  option of foomatic-configure.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: For Foomatic PPDs let 'make' and 'model'
	  fields be put into the Perl data structure generated by
	  ppdtoperl().
	
2003-01-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure.in: Made URIs for printer connections ("-c"
	  option) absolutely compatible to CUPS (Now one can use
	  "parallel:...", "usb:...", and "serial:..."). Automatic
	  conversion of USB URIs to URIs referring to manufacturer, model,
	  and serial number of the printer under CUPS 1.1.17 or newer.
	  Support for the MTink daemon from http://xwtools.automatix.de/.
	
	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved sorting of option choices. Made it
	  faster and removed the long list of resolutions. Let the
	  "normalizename()" function also support strings with more than
	  one number and with floating point numbers.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in: Added paths for
	  the new features of "foomatic-configure".

	* README, USAGE: Documented the new features of
	  "foomatic-configure".

2003-01-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixes for Adobe compliance of the generated
	  PPD files: In "*Product: ..." IEEE model name has to be in
	  parantheses, "*ShortNickName: ..." must be different for all PPD
	  files, driver name added to achieve this, "*ShortNickName: ..."
	  entry has to come before "*NickName: ...".

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: Now the "*Nickname"
	  and "*ModelName" entries of the PPD file get marked when the
	  recommended driver is used.
	
2003-01-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed a typo in the calculation of the
	  values in the "*ImageableArea" lines of the PPD files.

2003-01-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Support for margin settings in a printer
	  entry of a driver XML file (combo-specific margins).

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Bigger buffer for printer entry of
	  driver XML files (needed for margin info, especially of
	  Gimp-Print driver).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Unprintable margins as defined in the XML
	  files are used for the "*ImageableArea" and "*HWMargins" lines in 
	  the PPD files now.
	
2003-01-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c: Parse data about unprintable margins in
	  printer, driver, and combo XML files.

2002-12-31  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow boolean options to be used as member
	  options for composite options. To add the "From<Composite>"
	  choice, booleanm member options will be implemented as
	  enumerated choice options in the PPD file. In the
	  "<ev_driverval>" entries in the XML file the boolean options
	  have to be expressed as "Option=true", "Option=false", "Option"
	  (means "true"), or "noOption" (means "false").
	
2002-12-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 2.9.1. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-2_9_1".

	* README, USAGE, Foomatic-Devel-Ideas.txt: Updated for version
	  2.9.1.
	
2002-12-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Allow settings for options which do not
	  exist for the current printer/driver combo in the choices of
	  composite options. These will be deleted from the composite
	  option in the final PPD file. With this it gets much easier
	  to set up the composite option, for example the one for the
	  "pxlmono" driver where some printers have the PJL option
	  "Economode" and some not. So one simply puts in settings for
	  "Economode" and these are only used for the appropriate
	  printers. So much less constraints are needed in the XML
	  file for the composite option.
	
2002-12-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let "getppd()" put the member options of a
	  composite option into a main group and not into a subgroup of
	  the group where the composite option is located. Most frontends
	  do not support subroups.

2002-12-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: use longname of composite option in the
	  longnames of the "From<composite>" choices in the member options
	  (ex: "FromPrintoutMode" -> "Controlled by 'Printout Mode'").

2002-12-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Modified keyword lists for sorting options
	  and choices according to the new agreement that the composite
	  option for pre-made configurations has the name "PrintoutMode"
	  and the choices "Draft", "Normal", "High", "VeryHigh", "Photo",
	  with the modifiers ".Gray", and ".Mono".

2002-12-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improvements for composite options.

	  Given highest priority in the sort order to the option name
	  "DocumentType", the name of the composite option forseen to
	  give quick access to the most important configurations.

	  if the translation (longname) for the name of an option, a
	  group, or a choice is missing, it will be generated from
	  the shortname, using the new function "longname()".

	  Do not take into account enumerated choice options with only one
	  choice when setting option group definitions in the PPD file.

	  Fixed closing of subgroups when the PPD file ends (there was
	  "*CloseGroup", not "*CloseSubGroup").

	  Suppress composite options on the "Execution details" web pages.
	
2002-12-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: Introduced support for
	  composite options.  The "genppd()" now does all steps to
	  correctly set up a composite option in the PPD file (Marking
	  composite option appropriately, letting its "code" be put into
	  the PostScript stream before the code of all members, putting
	  members in a group named after the composite option, add
	  "Controlled by '<Composite>'" setting to the
	  members). Limitations for now are:

	   - Composite options must be enumerated choice (will most
	     probably always be the case).

	   - Members must be enumerated choice (one could later add
	     boolean, then "genppd()" would need to convert that
	     boolean options into enumerated choice, that they can
	     have the additional choice).

	   - Members can be every execution style except composite
	     (otherwise the option groups would get messy).

	  The second and the third limitation only concern the PPD file
	  generation with the "genppd()" function, not the job processing
	  with "foomatic-rip".
	
2002-12-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let parantheses being removed in the
	  suggested file names for the PPDs.

2002-12-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: Added the "gdi" and "pbmtozjs"
	  drivers to the ranking in "foomatic-preferred-driver", tolerate
	  not having a preferred driver when there is a "Paperweight" with
	  drivers assigned to it.
	
2002-12-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 2.9.0. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-2_9_0".
	
2002-12-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm, foomatic-perl-data.c: First preparations
	  for collective options, let these options being skipped for
	  2.9.0 release, so that collective options can be added to the
	  database before 2.9.1 without 2.9.0 breaking. Let options with
	  unknown execution style being skipped in general.
	
2002-11-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Tagged CVS for the release of foomatic-db-engine 2.9.0pre1. 
	  Tag name: "foomatic-db-engine-2_9_0pre1".
	
	* README: Added list of implemented and planned features for
	  Foomatic 3.0.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed calls of "dossy" line ends removal
	  ("undossify();") when reading the PPD file and quoted the
	  asterisk in "/^\*End/".

2002-11-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Fixed connection to the other Foomatic
	  packages in both regular and "inplace" installation.

	  Insert absolute paths for the Perl library and database locations
	  in the "inplace" installation.

	  Set link to "foomatic-rip" into the source directory when
	  installing "inplace", so one can start all programs from
	  one directory.

	  Let files of "foomatic-templates" directory be installed into
	  /usr/share/foomatic/templates, so that "foomatic-addpjloptions"
	  also works with a regular installation (worked only "inplace"
	  before).

	* makeDefaults.in: Removed paths for old src/*omatic filters,
	  added path for "foomatic-rip" and for PPR daemon
	  ("foomatic-configure" needs the daemon to check the PPR version).

	  Insert absolute paths for the database location ($libdir) in the
	  "inplace" installation.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Improved header text of the PPD files:
	  GPL, Foomatic 2.9 URL, "foomatic-rip", download instructions.

	  When an option has only one choice and therefore is described
	  only with "*Foomatic" keywords in the PPD file, the "*End" was
	  not inserted when the option code needed more than one line.
	
	* foomatic-configure.in: Used path from Defaults.pm for calls of
	  "foomatic-rip" when generating PDQ driver files.

	* foomatic-addpjloptions.8.in: Updated path in "FILES" section.

	* README, USAGE, TODO: Updated pacckage documentation for the
	  Foomatic 2.9.0 release.

	* etc/printcap: Removed this file, it is not needed for the
	  package.
	
2002-11-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed the generator functions for the
	  old Perly Foomatic 2.0 PPDs, old-style CUPS PPDs, lpdomatic/
	  directomatic printer description files, PDQ driver files,
	  and MagicFilter printer definition files.

	  Added functions to parse the new Perl-free Foomatic 2.9 PPD
	  files, to read out and update the option defaults and the
	  postpipe.

	  In the "Execution Details" web page generation taken into
	  account that foomatic-rip now allows the same spot letter ("%A",
	  "%B", ...) being more than once in the prototype so that option
	  settings can act on several points of the command line.

	* lib/Foomatic/GrovePath.pm: Removed because it is not needed any
	  more.

	* foomatic-configure.in: Adapted to the new concept of
	  foomatic-rip and PPD files. Removed the generation of combo XML
	  files in /etc/foomatic/.

	* foomatic-compiledb.in: Removed support for all output file types
	  except PPD and XML.

	* foomatic-datafile.in, foomatic-datafile.1.in: Removed, we have
	  foomatic-ppdfile as replacement.

	* foomatic-ppdfile.in, foomatic-ppdfile.1.in: Replacement for
	  foomatic-datafile, produces only PPD files, no other file types

	* foomatic-compiledb.1.in, foomatic-configure.1.in: Updated man
	  pages.

	* Makefile.in, configure.in: Adapted to the name change
	  "foomatic-datafile" -> "foomatic-ppdfile".
	
2002-11-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed PostScript code for custom paper
	  sizes.

2002-11-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let "foomatic-rip" instead of "cupsomatic"
	  being used as CUPS filter defined in the "*cupsFilter" line of
	  the new PPD files.

2002-11-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed small bug in PPD generation correcting
	  a "CmdLine" keyword, added some comments.
	
2002-10-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Do not add "*VariablePaperSize: False" to
	  the PPD file when variable page sizes are supported.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Encoding of option code: When splitting long
	  lines, mark the end with "&&" to distinguish between split lines
	  and newlines. Make colon and opening quotes of a PPD line with
	  code always being in the same line as the keyword.

2002-10-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-datafile.in: Changed meaning of the "-t" settings:
	  "cups" produces a PPD-O-Matic PPD now and "cupsold" the old
	  CUP-O-Matic PPD. All other choices behave the same as before.
	  This leads to the KDE Printing Manager generating PPD-O-Matic
	  PPDs.

	* foomatic-datafile.1.in: Updated man page to mention the choices
	  "cupsold", "lprng", and "direct" for the "-t" option of
	  "foomatic-datafile".
	
2002-10-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: Added new drivers: "hpijs-rss",
	  "lxm3200-tweaked", "lz11".

2002-10-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: After Grant Taylor discovered a huge
	  security hole in the original concept of the Perl-free PPDs,
	  changed to a new concept. The former concept was that the
	  GhostScript command line and all snippets to insert into the
	  command line are stuffed into the PostScript data by the client
	  (so having the PPD file on the server was not required). This
	  leads to the case that every user can run arbitrary programs on
	  the server. In the new concept the client stuffs only key/value
	  pairs for the option settings into the PostScript data (as in
	  Foomatic 2.0.x), the server will read the command line
	  information from the PPD file and build the command line
	  according to the settings in the PostScript data. The PPD files
	  do not contain any important information in comment lines, so
	  that if a program strips off the comments, nothing will break.
	  All information is stored in Adobe-compliant PPD structures and
	  only the really needed information is stored, with a minimum of
	  redundancy, so the new PPDs are more easily customizable.

2002-10-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Introduced new function "getppd()" which
	  generates the new PPDs which do not need the Perl data eny more
	  (see discussion with Johannes Meixner on the foomatic-devel list
	  on linuxprinting.org), started option group support (use
	  "<arg_group>group/subgroup</arg_group>" tag in "<arg_execution>"
	  section of option XML files), option groups work, but there are
	  no "longnames"/translations yet. Fixed some typos.

	* foomatic-datafile.in: When one uses "foomatic-datafile -t ppd
	  ...", the new Perl-less PPD files are generated.
	
	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed "*ImageableArea" and "*PaperDimension"
	  in the PPD-O-Matic PPD files. It got broken when introducing the
	  code for variable paper size support.

2002-10-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Support for custom
	  page sizes. A choice named "Custom" in the "PageSize" option is
	  considered as custom page size. Its "<ev_driverval>" should
	  contain a placeholder "%0" for the page width and "%1" for the
	  page height (both in points).  Alternatively the
	  "<ev_driverval>" can contain two zeros ("0") from which the
	  first will be replaced by the page width and the second by the
	  page height. PPD files will get Adobe-complient for the custom
	  page size support. So CUPS and the printing dialog of Mac OS X
	  should have no problems with the custom paper size. Now custom
	  paper sizes are available for all spoolers:

	  CUPS: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  LPRng: lpr -P huge -Z PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  GNUlpr: lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  LPD: lpr -P huge -JPageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  PPR: ppr -P huge -F "*PageSize Custom" -i 500x750cm bigposter.ps
	  PDQ: pdq -P huge -oPageSize_Custom -aPageWidth=500
	           -aPageHeight=750 -oPageSizeUnit_cm bigposter.ps
	  No spooler: directomatic -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm
	           bigposter.ps

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Support for unique
	  PC file names ("*PCFileName" in PPD file) in the Foomatic
	  PPD files ("<pcmodel>" 6-character string in printer entry,
	  "<pcdriver>" 2-character string in driver entry).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Adobe-compliant PPD file header entries.

	* README: Documentation for custom page sizes, PC file name
	  fragments ("<pcmodel>", "<pcdriver>), PostScript file sections
	  ("<arg_section>") in XML database.

2002-10-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-perl-data.c, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: "*OrderDependency"
	  lines in PPD files, started option group support
	  ("<arg_section>" and "<arg_group>" tags in the "<arg_execution>"
	  section of the option XML files).

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: "*End" lines after PPD option setting entries
	  with multiple-line PostScript code.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Support for custom paper sizes as described
	  in section 6.3 of Adobe's PPD 4.3 specification. If a
	  printer/driver combo has a choice named "Custom" in its PageSize
	  option, or a paper size which has at least one dimension being
	  zero, the combo is assumed to support custom paper sizes and the
	  PPD file gets supplied with the appropriate definitions. With
	  CUPS one can specify arbitrary paper sizes on the command line
	  then

	  lpr -P huge -o PageSize=Custom.500x750cm bigposter.ps
	
2002-10-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Set release number of all files to 3.0.
	
2002-10-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* README, USAGE: Updated documentation according to the splitted
	  packages.
	
2002-10-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* *: Splitted Foomatic into four packages:
	
	  - foomatic-filters: Filter scripts used by the spoolers to
	    convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's
	    native format using a printer/driver specific PPD file
	  - foomatic-db-engine: Foomatic's database engine generates
	    PPD files from the data in Foomatic's XML database. It also
	    contains scripts to directly generate print queues and handle
	    jobs.
	  - foomatic-db: The collected knowledge about printers, drivers,
	    and driver options in XML files, used by foomatic-db-engine
	    to generate PPD files.
	  - foomatic-db-hpijs: Foomatic XML data generator for HP's HPIJS
	    driver.
	
	  This package is foomatic-db-engine.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in: Removed all portions not needed for
	  foomatic-db-engine.

	* configure.in, Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in: Prepared the package
	  for using the Foomatic database from an external package
	  (usually foomatic-db).

	* configure.in: Fixed check to set /etc instead of /usr/local/etc
	  as $sysconfdir.
	
	* lib/Foomatic/DB_perl_xml.pm: This file is obsolete, removed.

2002-10-07  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>
   
	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap,
	  db/source/printer/HP-Business_Inkjet_3000.xml: The HP Business
	  Inkjet 3000 does not work with the HPIJS driver.

	* db/source/printer/122496.xml,
	  db/source/printer/HP-DesignJet_750.xml: Removed hint that IJS
	  driver has problem with large paper sizes. This is fixed.
	
2002-10-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/*: Added "largeformat-PageSize.xml" special page
	  size option for large format printers (drivers "dnj650c" and
	  "Postscript"). Now Foomatic supports paper sizes larger than A3
	  with these printers.
	
2002-10-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added the "lz11" driver entry (enhanced version
	  of "cZ11" for the Lexmark Z11 printer).

	* db/source/printer/*: Fixed auto-detection info of the HP Color
	  LaserJet 4500 and removed wrong auto-detection info from the
	  Kyocera FS-1200.
	
2002-10-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added driver entry "lxm3200-tweaked", the
	  "lxm3200" driver modified to also support the Lexmark Z31 and
	  Z12.

	* db/source/printer/*: Rated the Lexmark Z31 as "Mostly" and the
	  Z12 as "Partially", due to the "lxm3200-tweaked" driver.
	
	* db/source/printer/Epson-Stylus_CX3200.xml: Changed rating to
	  "Paperweight" (nothing known about this device yet).

	* db/source/*/*: Fixed "stc300.upp" driver, execution information
	  was missing, new URL.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Epson MJ 520C to the list of supported
	  printers of the "stcolor", "stcany.upp", and "stc300.upp"
	  drivers. It is unclear whether it works with Gimp-Print.
	
2002-10-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added more japanese Epson inkjets: Epson CL
	  700, 750, Epson EM 900C, 900CN, 930C, 930CN, MC 2000, 7000,
	  9000, MJ 520C, 5100C, 6000C, 8000C, PM 760C, 800C, 820C, 850PT,

	* db/source/printer/*: Removed broken printer entries for the
	  Epson PM 760C, 770C, 800C, 820C/3300C, "Stylus PM760", "Stylus
	  PM820".

	* db/source/printer/*: Re-rated the Epson Stylus Photo 785, 825,
	  875, 895, 915, and 925 from "Perfectly" to "Mostly" because one
	  cannot access the photo card readers with free software. Also
	  updated the text appropriately.

	* db/source/printer/Epson-Stylus_Pro*: Removed hint that IJS
	  driver has problem with large paper sizes. This is fixed.

	* db/source/driver/filter*, db/source/opt/jap*: Removed the
	  "filter*" drivers. I don't know where one can download these
	  drivers.

	* db/source/driver/PM*: Updated the driver entries to use the new,
	  correct printer entries.

2002-10-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added japanese Epson inkjets: Epson MC

2002-09-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap, db/source/printer/*:
	  Bugfix: The HP DeskJet 612x printers do not support full-bleed
	  printing.

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap, db/source/*/*: Added
	  the HP Business Inkjet 3000, DesignJet 5500, 5500ps, LaserJet
	  5100, Color LaserJet 2500, 5500.
	
2002-09-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* data-generators/hpijs-rss/*: Added support for HPIJS patched by
	  Matthias Bunte and Richard Spencer-Smith (see
	  http://www.linuxprinting.org/download/printing/hpijs/). The
	  driver entry name is "hpijs-rss".

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-generator: Mentioned that the
	  current Foomatic data is also for HPIJS 1.2.2.

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap, db/source/printer/*:
	  Added the HP DeskJet 450, 3320, 6122, 6127, PhotoSmart P230, PSC
	  2150.

	* data-generators/hpijs*/hpijs*-generator: Corrected "Best
	  Grayscale" modes for the HP DeskJet 350, 6xxC series, and the
	  Apollo printers, the mode supports only 600x300 (not 300x300)
	  dpi and all except the DeskJet 350 and the 63xC series use
	  both and not only the black cartridge.

	* db/source/printer/*: Changed recommended driver to "hpijs-rss"
	  when it was "hpijs" before (the patched version has better
	  output quality).

	* db/source/printer/*: Raised ratings of all "DJ9xx"-class HP
	  inkjets without fax facility from "Mostly" to
	  "Perfectly". Updated the texts of all "DJ9xx"-class models
	  (because of the patched HPIJS, "hpijs-rss").
	
	* db/source/printer/*: Raised ratings of the HP PPA printers
	  (supported by the "pnm2ppa" driver from "Mostly" to "Perfectly",
	  the driver supports their full functionality.
	
	* db/source/driver/PostScript.xml: Added link to Kurt Pfeifle's
	  tutorial chapter about PostScript to the text of the
	  "Postscript" driver entry.

2002-09-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in: Made command line option list only be
	  logged in debug mode. Mac OS X adds very many options to the
	  CUPS filter chain and so the option list gets longer than 1024
	  bytes and this CUPS cannot handle in its error_log file.
	
2002-09-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/driver/Postscript.xml: Updated text for new PPD file
	  download place.
	
2002-09-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-generator: The 300-dpi normal mode
	  for the "LJMono" device class uses 600 dpi internally and so
	  does not work on the 300-dpi-only printers as the HP LaserJet 4L.
	  Restricted these printers to use the 300-dpi draft mode which
	  does real 300 dpi.
	
2002-08-31  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/*, db/source/driver/pnm2ppa.xml: Cleaned up
	  options for the "pnm2ppa" driver.
	
2002-08-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/HP-LaserJet_1000.xml: Updated text and rating
	  ("Partially") according to a longer posting of the author of the
	  "pbmtozjs" driver.

	* db/source/driver/oki4w.xml: Added additional hint about the
	  setup of print queues with this driver to the text.
	
2002-08-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/driver/pbmtozjs.xml,
	  db/source/opt/pbmtozjs-PageSize.xml: Added driver for the
	  HP LaserJet 1000.

	* db/source/printer/HP-LaserJet_1000.xml: Updated text and rating
	  ("Mostly").
	
	* foomatic-configure.in, configure.in, Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in,
	  USAGE: Added support for HPOJ 0.9.

	* README, USAGE: Corrected version number.
	
2002-08-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added the HP PSC 2110 and 2210, replaced
	  the HP PSC 300 by the HP PSC 370 and 380, text fixes for the
	  HP DeskJet 5550 and 5551, PhotoSmart 7150, 7350, and 7550,
	  Epson Stylus C61 and C62.
	
	* db/source/printer/*: Corrected/updated "Recommended driver" and
	  texts for Epson Stylus Photo 950, 960, 2100, 2200, Stylus Pro
	  7600, 9600, and HP DeskJet 3420.

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap: Added HP PSC 370, 380,
	  2110, 2210, removed HP PSC 300.
	
2002-08-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in, src/directomatic.pl.in, src/lpdomatic.pl.in:
	  Now option settings stuffed into the PPD files have priority
	  against settings done via command line options given with the
	  printing command. This is done to make sure that settings given
	  in applications (also on clients with other spooler/OS) have are
	  taken into account.

	* src/cupsomatic.pl.in: Numerical options give on the command line
	  and not being exactly of a value given as choice in the
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD file are now overriding the PPD defaults which
	  "pstops" inserts into the PostScript, but they are overridden
	  when an application stuffs settings into the PostScript file.
	
2002-08-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-generator,
	  data-generators/hpijs/hpijs-printermap: Updated to HPIJS 1.2.1,
	  previous file versions in data-generators/hpijs/ tagged with
	  "hpijs-1_2-files".

	* *: Before the update to HPIJS 1.2.1 tagged all files of the
	  repository with "hpijs-1_2".

	* db/source/printer/*: Switched "recommended driver" of the HP
	  DeskJet 400 and 420C to "hpijs", updated text and rating of HP
	  DeskJet 420C.

	* Makefile.in: In the "inplace" mode the line "use lib/;" and not
	  "use lib/Foomatic/;" must be inserted to make the scripts using

	  (i7tiol at t-online dot de).

	* db/source/printer/*: Added auto-detection info to the HP LaserJet
	  2100. Due to the 2100 and 2100M having the same auto-detection

	* foomatic-preferred-driver.in: Updated driver priority list to
	  give higher priority to the old HP LaserJet/PCL drivers coming
	  with GhostScript than to Gimp-Print. The old drivers work better
	  on laser printers.

	* db/source/printer/*: Use the old GhostScript driers ("ljet4",
	  "laserjet", ...) instead of "gimp-print-ijs" as recommended
	  driver for laser printers.

2002-05-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Corrected "hpijs" entry for the HP 2500C/2500CN,
	  they belong to the "DJ9xxVIP" group (as the HP DeskJet 990C), so
	  they work perfectly with "hpijs". Replaced model string "HP
	  BUSINESS INKJET 2250" by "DESKJET 990", the former string is
	  not recognized by "hpijs" (in contrary to the driver's
	  documentation).

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Sony IJP-V100 multi-function device.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added '*PSVersion: "(3010.000) 653"' entry

	  name is only "Bx" without "JIS" or "ISO". This is also the
	  default of GhostScript.
	
	* Makefile.in: Fixed bug of database going to
	  /usr/local/share/share/foomatic.

	* foomatic-configure.in: Made "foomatic-configure -Q -q -r"
	  working correctly with CUPS 1.1.14.

	* Makefile.in, makeDefaults.in, configure.in, lib/Foomatic/DB.pm:
	  Eliminated dependency on the "libwww-perl" Perl library, used
	  command line tools "wget" or "curl" instead. Now Foomatic should
	  work only with standard Perl libraries as being part of Perl
	  itself.

	* USAGE, README: Added the requirement of one of the tools "wget"
	  and "curl".

	* db/source/driver/gdi.xml: Updates URLs.

2002-04-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-ppdload: Switched foomatic-ppdload to the new
	  Perl-XML/Grove-free DB.pm.

	* foomatic-ppdload, foomatic-ppdload.8.in: Added "-R" option to
	  remove a printer from the "ppd" driver.

	* README: Removed paragraph that foomatic-ppdload needs the old
	  Perl-XML/Grove DB.pm.

	* lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: Let the "PageRegion" option in the PPD file
	  being skipped when creating Foomatic XML data. It is te same
	  option as "PageSize".

	* db/source/printer/HP-PSC_750.xml: Added USB auto-detection info.

2002-04-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Made the "sortargs()" and "sortvals()"
	  functions working with Perl 5.0x. The "sort()" function of these
	  old Perl versions only supports the two items to compare being
	  given to the copmaring function via the global variables "$a"
	  and "$b", and not via "@_". linuxprinting.org runs Perl 5.005.
	  Made also the choices for the options better sorted, especially
	  Letter/A4 paper sizes in the beginning of the list, resolutions
	  and "Upper"/"Middle"/"Lower" trays correctly sorted, "Default"
	  in the beginning of the lists.

2002-04-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>
	
	* foomatic-perl-data.c: New C program to parse the XML code to
	  generate Perl data structures from it. Uses libxml (libxml 2.x
	  recommended because otherwise XML files beginning with a blank
	  line cannot be read).
	
	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed disk cache and XML/Grove Perl
	  library usage completely, all XML handling is done by C code
	  now. Added paper sizes of the Dymo-CoStar/Avery label printers
	  to the "getpapersize()" function, now the "ImageableArea" and
	  "PaperDimension" entries in the PPD files are built correctly
	  for these printers. Added possibility to output a combo XML file
	  with the option default settings set to the values of the queue
	  currently worked on.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB_perl_xml.pm: Stored old XML/Grove/disk cache
	  version of the Foomatic database library. Added documentation
	  for this file as comments in its beginning.

	* foomatic-configure, foomatic-printjob: Removed "grove-pathval"
	  expression from "use Foomatic::DB.pm" line.

	* foomatic-configure: When a printer queue is set up or modified,
	  the option default settings are also set in the
	  /etc/foomatic/<queue>.xml.gz printer/driver combo XML file. So
	  frontends can also read the option settings from the XML file.

	* foomatic-ppdload: Re-linked to old lib/Foomatic/DB_perl_xml.pm,
	  Perl-XML/Grove-free version not implemented yet.

	* foomatic-compiledb, foomatic-compiledb.8.in,
	  foomatic-compiledb.1.in: In the cache-less time this has a new
	  purpose: It generates data files for a chosen spooler (or combo
	  XML files) and for either selected or all drivers. Moved man
	  page to section 1, foomatic-compiledb works from a normal user
	  account now (due to the removed cache).

	* foomatic-datafile.8.in, foomatic-datafile.1.in: Moved man
	  page to section 1, foomatic-datafile works from a normal user
	  account now (due to the removed cache).

	* foomatic-fix-xml: Remove leading blank lines from the XML files
	  in the local Foomatic database. The leading blank lines make the
	  XML files not readable by libxml 1.x.

	* Makefile: Added compilation and installation of
	  foomatic-perl-data.c.

	* Makefile, makeDefault: Commented out all cache-related stuff.
	
	* Makefile: Moved foomatic-datafile and foomatic-compiledb from
	  /usr/sbin to /usr/bin.

	* README, USAGE: Foomatic version 1.9 (Foomatic without
	  Perl-XML/Grove and without disk cache).

	* db/source/*/*: Replaced all occurences of a cross character
	  (used in resolutions as "600x300 dpi") by an "x" (the letter
	  "X").  libxml chokes on the cross. Removed leading blank lines
	  from the XML files, because this breaks libxml 1.x.

2002-04-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added new paper sizes of Gimp-Print to the
	  paper size table of the "getpapersize" function, fixed a bug of
	  wrong calculation of "wXXXhYYY" and "XXXxYYY" paper sizes in the
	  same function.

2002-03-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of all HP printers and
	  multi-function devices which need HPOJ or the modified printer.c
	  kernel module to be able to print via USB.

	  OLxxx models, so that they get correctly sorted in the printer
	  listings. Modified option entries appropriately.
	
2002-03-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of many HP and Apollo printers
	  and moved many of them from "Mostly" to "Perfectly".

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of HP OfficeJet G and K series

2002-03-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Introduced two debug output levels ("-v",
	  "-vv"). Now I do not need a special debug version any more.

2002-03-17  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* makeDefaults: Added flag $DEBUG to enable debug messages from
	  Perl modules. It is not exported by default, you can import it
	  by adding qw(:DEFAULT $DEBUG) to the "use Foomatic::Defaults"
	  clause.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Cache is disabled if CACHEDIR is set to an
	  empty string at compile time, ie. "make CACHEDIR=".

2002-03-17  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* debian/*: Docs README, TODO, USAGE were not included in the
	  debian package.
	  Changed handling of local changes by the debconf interface.

2002-03-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  for LPRng, the permissions for the /var/log/lp-errs file are set
	  correctly now.
	
2002-03-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added Lexmark E210 laser printer (Samsung ML-4500
	  clone, "gdi" driver).

	  was read.

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Fixed Red Hat bug #58319
	  (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58319).
	  Some PostScript files cannot be handled by "gs ... - < file",
	  but they need "gs ... /dev/fd/0 < file".

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed quoting for PDQ, now more complicated
	  driver command lines with quotes and shell script variables also
	  work with the PDQ-O-Matic config file generator. Assured that for
	  every call of GhostScript "foomatic-gswrapper" is used, to fix
	  Red Hat bug #58319 for all drivers, especially "Postscript".

	* src/*omatic.pl: Assured that for every call of GhostScript
	  "foomatic-gswrapper" is used, to fix Red Hat bug #58319 for all

	  in the database, but in reality they are not.

2002-03-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl, src/ppromatic.pl: Fixed reading default option
	  choices with a "+" from the PPD file.

2002-03-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* src/cupsomatic.pl: Disabled accounting for the "Postscript"
	  driver, it leads to an extra blank page coming out with every
	  job.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Cache files created by "foomatic-combo-xml"
	  were not read sometimes, fixed.

2002-02-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Added "remove_trash" target to remove temporary and
	  backup files created by editors and the patch utility. In
	  "testing_clean" target added "-f" to the "rm" command for the
	  links to the cache so that make does not stop with an error when
	  the links are not there.

2002-02-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, src/*omatic, filter.conf: Modified Foomatic to only
	  make the filter scripts out of the source files in src/. Fixed
	  bugs on filter script source files: "enscript -b <title>", not
	  "enscript -b=<title>"; empty title gave a line on the top of the
	  page when using "mpage". Added "-J" (job title) option to
	  directomatic. Added sample filter.conf.

	* cupsomatic, ppromatic, lpdomatic, directomatic: Removed obsolete
	  filter scripts.

	* directomatic.1.in: Added "-J" (job title) option.

	  Overwrite PATH in INPLACE version too.  Changed revision to 2.1
	  to avoid $lomversion clashes with the old scripts.

	* src/cupsomatic.pl, src/directomatic.pl, src/ppromatic.pl:
	  Bootstrapped from corresponding filter scripts.

	* src/Makefile: cupsomatic, directomatic and ppromatic get also
	  built.

2002-02-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults, foomatic-configure, USAGE, README: Added

	* lpdomatic: Corrected the path to the configuration file.

2002-01-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-kitload, foomatic-kitload.8.in: Added "-d" option to
	  install the kit into a staging area from which a package will
	  be built (as "DESTDIR=..." in GNU automake/autoconf). This is
	  a patch from Roger Leigh.

	* makeDefaults: Added the possibility to set the cache directory
	  alternatively with FOOMATIC_CACHEDIR instead of CACHEDIR.

	* cupsomatic, ppromatic, lpdomatic, directomatic: Modified parser
	  for options embedded in the job data so that option and value
	  names can contain all printable characters except white space
	  and "=". This fixed a problem with the "Color Mode" option of
	  the "pcl3" driver.
	
2002-01-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added the HP LaserJet 3P with PCL5 extension.
	
2002-01-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* USAGE: Minor text modifications for XPP 1.1.

	* db/source/*/*: Renamed the database entry for the Canon LIPS-II+
	  from "Canon-LIPS-II+" to "Canon-LIPS-IIplus". With the "+" in its
	  ID the printer entry was not accessible on the linuxprinting.org
	  web site.
	
2002-01-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Replaced "-sOutputFile=|cat>&3" by

	  with "pxlmono", updated text, rating, and recommended driver.

	* db/source/printer/*: Raised the rating for the Lexmark Z42 and
	  Compaq IJ1200 to "Mostly", to reflect the experience of the
	  author of "drv_z42" with these printers.

	* db/source/printer/*: Corrected the ratings/texts for the Epson
	  Stylus Pro 7000/7500/9000/9500/10000.

	* lpdomatic/makeDefaults: Modified the config file support to not
	  need a Perl library to make it easier to install lpdomatic without
	  installing the whole Foomatic package.	

2002-01-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added '*PSVersion: "(3010.000) 652"' entry
	  for GhostScript 6.52 to the PPD files.
	
2002-01-20  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	  job title with a2ps).
	* makeDefaults: Added code to write lib/Foomatic/ConfigFile.pm.
	* lpdomatic: Adds --center-title=$optJ to a2ps command line.
	  Enscriptcommand and debug flag can be specified in a config file
	  in $ETCDIR/filter.conf. Syntax is tag\s*:\s*value.
	  Added tabulator/indentation settings for emacs.

	* db/source/printer/Epson-AcuLaser_C1000.xml: Added the Epson
	  AcuLaser C1000 (Paperweight).

	* db/source/*/*: Applied a patch by Tim Waugh (twaugh at redhat
	  dot com) which makes the Perl one-liners for paper tray
	  selection on PCL laser printers working on both Perl 5.6.0 and
	  5.6.1.  The one-liners are in the GhostScript command lines of
	  the drivers entries for the PCL laser drivers ("lj5gray",
	  "ljet4", ...).

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated text of the Epson EPL-5900/5900PS
	  because of a bug in Epson's driver.
	
2002-01-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	  for Epson-Kowa laser driver 1.0.4.
	
2002-01-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic, ppromatic, directomatic: Auto-detection
	  of file converters a2ps, enscript, mpage, usage of the printer's
	  paper size setting for conversion to PostScript, with a2ps the
	  possibility to print also PDF, images, etc with LPD/LPRng and
	  with directomatic (CUPS and PPR do this by themselves, they use
	  the converter only for the docs pages).

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of "-Q" with PPR not working for
	  non-root users. CUPS queues are automatically set up with
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD files now (use "--oldppd" to get CUPS-O-Matic
	  PPD files), for PPD the PPD file is not stored twice any more, a
	  symbolic link is set instead.

	* README, ChangeLog, foomatic-configure.1.in: Updated documentation
	  to take into account the new "--oldppd" option.
	
	* db/source/*/*: HP removed the "HP only" clause from the license
	  of HPIJS, so HPIJS is free now.
	
2002-01-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed some incompatibilities in the PDQ file
	  generator which prevented HPIJS 1.0 from working with PDQ.
	
2002-01-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of foomatic-configure stopping on
	  directomatic printer configuration when there is no directomatic
	  config file.
	
2002-01-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic/ppromatic: The PPD default values of float options were
	  not read correctly, fixed.

2002-01-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added HP e-printer e20 to HPIJS 1.0 datafiles.

	* db/source/printers/*: Removed "Unverified" flags and cleaned up
	  text in many datafiles of HP inkjet printers.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Only set new default driver when the
	  current one is not OK.

	* foomatic-configure: Insert ":ppdfile=<PPD file name>:\" lines
	  into /etc/printcap (for LPD/GNUlpr/LPRng), so that the graphical
	  printing frontend GPR finds the PPD-O-Matic PPD files
	  automatically.
	
2002-01-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added "bjc250gs" driver and Canon BJC-250ex
	  printer.

2002-01-10  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-gswrapper: Replaced "-sOutputFile=|cat >&3" by
	  "-sOutputFile=|cat>&3" because the second one also works when
	  "gs" is a wrapper script around the real GhostScript binary.
	
2002-01-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Numerical options given on the command line were
	  ignored when using a PPD-O-Matic PPD file for the CUPS queue.
	  Fixed.
	
2002-01-08  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults, lpdomatic.8.in: Moved lpdomatic back to
	  /usr/sbin.
	
2002-01-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added support for direct, spooler-less
	  printing with directomatic, added auto-detection of PPR.

	* directomatic: Added support for having a default printer.

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "lprng" as possible datafile type (gives
	  the same result as "lpd").

	* foomatic-configure.1.in: Completed the list of possible options,
	  corrected "-D" options ("Default", not "Delete").

	* foomatic-printjob.1.in: Corrected command line for printing.

	* README, USAGE: Updated to take into account all recent changes.
	
2002-01-06  Manfred Wassmann  <manolo@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* foomatic-configure: Bails out if it encounters a lprng style
	  printcap, like those created by lprngtool, as it would hose it
	  otherwise.  This needs a better solution.
	* foomatic-configure.1.in: Added description of the above problem.
	* debian/control: The conflict with the cupsomatic-ppd package is
	  indicated.

2002-01-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added definitions for PPR and for
	  spooler-less printing.

	* db/source/driver/Postscript.xml: Updated the text to also
	  mention that PPD files can be used also with the PPR spooler or
	  the GPR printing frontend.

2002-01-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Made ppromatic stuffing the PostScript code of all
	  PostScript options into the job, in contrary to CUPS PPR only
	  stuffs in the code of options explicitly given on the command
	  line or in the "Switchset".

	* foomatic-configure: Added PPR support.
	
2002-01-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Made it possible to have PPD files in other
	  directories than /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles, let ppromatic eat up
	  data on STDIN to make documentation printing ("-i docs") working
	  correctly. When original job is not completely read, PPR does
	  not dequeue the print job and stops the printer because it
	  assumes that the job was not correctly printed.

2001-12-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Applied a patch from Crutcher Dunnavant
	  (crutcher@redhat.com) which sets all Perl variables in shell
	  command lines ($poid, $drv. $libdir, ...) into single quotes, so
	  that nothing breaks when a strange printer/driver ID or a
	  strangely named directory is used.

	* db/source/driver/*: Made Perl one-liner for paper tray selection

	  for overview request ("-O").

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Functions using "foomatic-combo-xml" check
	  the cache before and use it, if appropriate files
	  available. Printer ID set into single quotes in the
	  "foomatic-combo-xml" command line, to not break with the new
	  clear text printer IDs (Thanks to Crutcher Dunnavant,
	  crutcher@redhat.com for his suggestions).

	* Makefile: Let "make install" also install the man pages.
	
2001-12-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

2001-12-09  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Added support for the accounting facility of CUPS.
	  Only works with $debug = 0 and when GhostScript is rendering
	  the PostScript.

	* foomatic-ppdload, lib/Foomatic/PPD.pm: "new PPD" and "new

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "direct" data file type for 
	  Direct-O-Matic

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Modified comments of the LPD-O-Matic printer
	  description file (generated by the function "getlpddata()")

2001-12-07  Manfred Wassmann  <foomatic@NCC-1701.B.Shuttle.de>

	* Makefile: Split the install target into install-bin and
	  install-db. Added PHONY target to mark targets not related to
	  real files.
	* Manpages: Added a script to generate manpages with correct
	  pathnames from files named <manpage>.<section>.in.
	  Created more or less useable manpages for all binaries.
	* debian: Bootstrapped a debian directory for building Debian
	  packages.

2001-12-06  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Corrected link to documentation web page in the
	  comments in the beginning of the script.
	
2001-12-04  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic, ppromatic: Cleaned up multi-processing,
	  now the parent processes wait for their children to finish and
	  the interprocess communication pipes are closed after use. The
	  main process waiting for their children to exit fixes especially
	  a problem of lpdomatic: LPRng resetted the printer port when the
	  lpdomatic was ready, but in reality lpdomatic sub-processes were
	  still working on the job, which lead to incomplete pages being
	  printed (Bug #486096 on SourceForge). Also updated the comments
	  in the beginning of the files

	* foomatic-datafile: Added PPR support.

	* foomatic-configure: Added the "-w 1" option to "nc" used in the
	  $postpipe for LPD, otherwise "nc" only exits a rather long time
	  after all data has be transmitted to the printer. This prevents
	  the new lpdomatic from exiting immediately after the job has
	  finished and so it takes a longer time until the next job
	  starts.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Used "/PageSize[...]" instead of
	  "/PageRegion[...]" in the "*PageRegion" option of the
	  PPD-O-Matic PPD files becasue GhostScript does not understand
	  "/PageRegion[...]" (found this out during tests of PPR, which
	  uses the "*PageRegion" option and not the "*PageSize" option to
	  set the paper size.
	
2001-12-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Completed first version of ppromatic: Added error and
	  signal handling. Introduced back channel from child processes to
	  main process and let main process wait until all children finish,
	  to not loose any error message or exit status to report to PPR.
	
2001-11-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added some comments about the similarity of the
	  Sharp and Xerox inkjets.
	
	* db/source/opt/207.xml: Made "Model" option of "pcl3" having only
	  the correct model entry as possible choice (as "Model" option of
	  "gimp-print"/"stp".
	
2001-11-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Higher priority for "pcl3" against
	  "sharp.upp", the support of the "pcl3" driver for the Sharp and
	  Xerox inkjets is much better since version 3.3 of "pcl3".

	* db/source/*/*: Added Sharp/Xerox printers to list of printers
	  supported by "pcl3" because of better Sharp/Xerox support by
	  "pcl3" version 3.3, also changed the recommended driver of the
	  Sharp and Xerox inkjets to "pcl3" and the functionality to
	  "Mostly".
	
2001-11-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* ppromatic: Interface for the spooler PPR (ppr.sourceforge.net)
	  introduced. To set up printer download PPD-O-Matic PPD file from
	  your driver's page of the linuxprinting.org database (or use
	  "foomatic-datafile -t ppd ...") and do

	    cp ppromatic /usr/lib/ppr/interfaces/
	    cp <downloaded ppd file> /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/
	    ppad interface <queue> ppromatic <address>
	    ppad options <queue> backend=<interface>
	    ppad ppd <queue> <ppd file without path>
	    (Addiyional command to set up paper trays)

	  <interface> means the PPR interface name for the desired printer
	  connection type (all in /usr/lib/ppr/interfaces/: parallel,
	  serial, tcpip, lpr, smb, atalk, ...).
	  <address> means the printer address as needed by the interface
	  (/dev/lp0 for parallel, printer.domain.com:9100 for tcpip, ...)
	  <ppd file without path> is the name under which you have saved
	  your downloaded PPD file. Do not specify the path 
	  /usr/share/ppr/PPDFiles/

2001-11-23  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Let numerical option default settings in be used

	  Especially USAGE contains info about printing with graphical
	  interfaces and out of applications now.
	
2001-11-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Added the "sj48" driver in the list,
	  so that when one adds "omni" as the last entry, the "sj48" will

	  file (PPD-O-Matic), made generated PDQ scripts using settings
	  added by an application using the PPD file, fixed bug of PDQ not
	  printing when driver command line is composed of various shell
	  commands. Removed some replacements of special characters in the
	  generation of PDQ config files, they caused some driver command
	  lines to get "overquoted" characters.

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic: Added support for the new generic PPD
	  files, jobs are searched for settings done by applications using
	  these PPD files.

	* foomatic-datafile: Added "-t ppd" option to generate generic PPD
	  files.

	* db/source/driver/*: Added "-Mutf8" to the "perl" calls in the
	  command line of the PCL/PCL-XL laser printer drivers with tray
	  selection, otherwise Perl 5.6.0 and older cannot handle hex
	  representations of binary strings in the Perl commands.

	* db/source/printer/123776.xml: Corrections in the text about the
	  BJC-8200.
	
	* db/source/printer/Canon-S600.xml: Added the Canon S600.

	* db/source/*/*: Added Foomatic data for the UPP files for the
	  Canon BJC-8200 which come with GhostScript 6.50 or newer.

	* db/source/driver/pcl3.xml: Fixed typo.

2001-09-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: In the "loadfile()" function "close" was
	  used instead of "fclose". This kept all files open and lead to
	  problems with more than 1000 printer models.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Xerox DocuPrint N4512, corrected comments
	  for the HP PSC 950 and the Epson Stylus C80.
	
2001-09-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Given priority to the lxm3200 driver
	  against Gimp-Print/stp, the support of the Lexmark 3200 by
	  Gimp-Print is broken.

2001-09-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Fixed a bug of not setting the high scores
	  for the constraints.
	
2001-09-22  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: "checkpc -f" after any change on an LPRng
	  system. LPRng refuses to print when one file has wrong
	  permissions.
	
2001-09-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* cupsomatic: Made the "sides" (Duplex) option of CUPS working
	  with printers using Foomatic.

	* foomatic-configure: SIGHUP to LPRng daemon when setting the
	  default printer or deleting one.

2001-09-12  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added the Lexmark Z23, Z33, and Z53

	* db/source/printer/486066.xml: The Lexmark Z12 does not print
 	  ain text

	* db/source/printer/328553.xml: With the current Gimp-Print the
	  Lexmark Z52 works "Perfectly".

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated and corrected text of the Lexmark
	  Z23, Z33, and Z52.

	* db/source/printer/62720.xml, db/source/driver/lj5*: The HP
	  LaserJet 5L does not work with the lj5gray/lj5mono drivers.

	* cupsomatic: All enumerated options with choices "On", "Off",
	  "Yes", "No", "True", or "False" did not work with CUPS. This is
	  fixed now.
	
2001-09-03  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Possibility to set a system-wide default
	  printer for all spoolers, for CUPS and PDQ, non-root users can
	  also set a personal default printer. Due to the architecture of
	  LPD a queue named "lp" will be renamed when another queue is set
	  as the default queue.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added the "lpoptions" utility of CUPS
	  which is needed to set a remote printer as default or to set
	  a personal default printer for non-root users.

	* USAGE: Added information about the new default printer setting
	  facility.

	* README: Adapted to all recent changes.

	* TODO: Removed the topic about speed and memory consumption, this
	  is solved by foomatic-combo-xml.c now.
	
2001-09-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: Added functionality for generating the
	  overview XML file ("-O" option). Makes the overview XML
	  generation much faster, less than a second on most machines.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Let the overview XML generation be done
	  preferrably by foomatic-combo-xml.c.

	* Makefile: Added the removal of the foomatic-combo-xml binary
	  to the "clean" section, let foomatic-preferred-driver be
	  installed in /usr/sbin.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Bugfix: Often default driver entries
	  were not inserted into the printer XML file.
	
	* db/source/driver/ppmtocpva.xml: Added the Alps MD-1500 printer.
	
2001-08-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Several fixes on the comments of the HP
	  OfficeJets.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the Apple LaserWriter 4/600.

	* db/source/printer/605074.xml, db/source/printer/609714.xml:
	  Correction: The HP LaserJet 5Si and 3200se support PJL.

	* db/source/driver/lj5gray.xml: Removed duplicate entry for the
	  HP LaserJet 5Si.
	
2001-08-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-combo-xml.c: C program to build XML files for
	  printer/driver combos, around 600 times faster than the perl
	  routines in lib/Foomatic/DB.pm (one Gimp-Print combo in 0.5-1.5
	  sec. foomatic-compiledb in a few minutes), needs less than 10 MB
	  of memory. Pre-building of the database for distros not needed
	  any more.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Make foomatic-combo-xml.c being preferrably
	  used for building printer/driver combo data.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Integration of foomatic-combo-xml.c.
	
2001-08-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/driver/*: Removed printer entry 207945 from the printer
	  list of the "laserjet" and "stp" drivers, the printer was deleted.
	
2001-08-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/HP-DesignJet_750.xml: added HP DesignJet 750,
	  it is supported by Gimp-Print now.
	
2001-08-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added a whole bunch of japanese printers and
	  drivers, thanks to Crutcher Dunnavant from Red Hat.

	* db/source/driver/md2k.xml: Added the Alps MD-1500.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Priorities for the japanese drivers.

	  by Epson: "epl5800", "epl2050", "epl2050p", "acl2000", "acl8500".
	
	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Epson laser printer drivers.

	* db/source/printer/641170.xml: Removed duplicate entry for the
	  Canon LBP-800.

2001-08-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/*/*: Added new Brother printers: HL-1440, H:-1450,
	  HL-1470N, HL-2460, HL-2460N, HL-2400CeN, HL-3400CN, MFC-P2500.

	* db/source/*/*: Added some more Brothers to the hl1250 driver.

	* db/source/opt/207.xml, db/source/opt/208.xml: Corrected default
	  settings for the Apollo P-1200 with the pcl3 driver. It needs
	  the the model setting "Unspecified old model" and a CMY colour
	  mode.

	* db/source/driver/hpijs.xml, db/source/opt/hpijs-Model.xml,
	  db/source/opt/hpijs-Quality.xml, db/source/printer/413737.xml:
	  The Apollo P-2200 works with drivers for the HP DeskJet 612C,
	  taken this into account.

	* db/source/printer/Okidata-ML_32?.xml, db/source/driver/okiibm.xml:
	  Added the printers Okidata ML 320/321.

	* db/source/printer/63200.xml: Added comment to the IBM 4019.

	* db/source/printer/317321.xml, db/source/printer/607474.xml:
	  Added instructions how to change the cartridges without needing
	  special software.

	* db/source/printer/24832.xml: Added useful info about the NEC P6
	  plus.

	* db/source/driver/epsonc.xml: This driver is needed to print on
	  the NEC PinWriter P6/P6 plus in colour.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Given priority to the "necp6" driver
	  against the "epsonc" because in most cases the NEC PinWriter P6
	  is used without colour add-on.

	* db/source/*/*: Fixed bug in hpijs driver data: The docs talk about
	  "DJ6xxP" for the "DeviceName" setting for photo-capable DeskJet
	  6xx models, in reality "DJ6xxPhoto" has to be used.

	* db/source/driver/sharp.upp.xml: Explained how to install
	  "sharp.upp".

2001-08-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/337577.xml: Duplicate entry for the HP OfficeJet
	  G55, deleted.

	* db/source/printer/Sharp*: Added the printers Sharp AJ-1805,
	  AJ-2005, and AJ-2100.

	* db/source/printer/*: Updated the entries for the Xerox DocuPrint
	  M750 and M760, they print with "sharp.upp" and are both partially
	  working.

	* db/source/driver/sharp.upp.xml: Added the new Sharp printers 
	  (AJ-1805/2005) and the Xerox DucuPrint M750/M760.

	* db/source/driver/hl1250.xml: Updated the URL of the driver's home
	  page.

	* db/source/driver/hl1250.xml, db/source/opt/53.xml: Removed the
	  "Model" option from the "hl1250" driver, the GhostScript option
	  "-sDEVICE=hl1240" or "-sDEVICE=hl1250" only determines the
	  default resolution which is anyway overridden by Foomatic.

	* db/source/opt/161.xml: The media source selection for the
	  "Postscript" driver only works for HP printers, restricted to HP.
	
2001-08-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/printer/*: Added HP and Apollo printers: Apollo P-2100,
	  P-2150, HP DeskJet 816C, 980C, e-printer e20, PhotoSmart P1215,
	  P1218, OfficeJet K60, K80, V40, PSC 300, 750.

	* db/source/*/hpijs*: Updated the data for the inkjet driver of HP
	  ("hpijs").

	* db/source/*/DJ*: Deleted the old data of the HP driver (drivers
	  "DJxxx").

	* db/source/*/*: Updated all information about the multifunction
	  devices of HP, they are all capable for scanning with free 
	  software.

	* db/source/printer/641138.xml: Duplicate entry for the Canon
	  LBP-800, deleted.

	* db/source/printer/207945.xml: Duplicate entry for the HP LaserJet
	  2, deleted.

	* foomatic-preferred-driver: Added new "hpijs" driver.

2001-08-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Moved foomatic-configure from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin.
	
	* db/source/printer/Epson-Stylus_C[24]0*: Split up the entries for
	  the Epson Stylus C20/C40 into the SX and UX models. This is needed
	  for the Gimp-Print GhostScript driver.

2001-08-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for printers on NetWare (with LPD
	  and LPRng), output of the printer list both as root and normal
	  user, LPRng SIGHUP after adding a new queue, spooler detection
	  bug fix.
	
2001-08-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Fixed bug of options not being conserved
	  when changing parameters of a CUPS or PDQ printer. $olddatablob
	  was defined at the wrong place. Added paths for rlpr, nc, and
	  smbclient to Defaults.pm, so these commands can also be called
	  when foomatic-configure is running in an environment without
	  $PATH, for example during the installation of a distro.

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Paths for rlpr, nc, and smbclient added.
	
2001-08-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* db/source/opt/ppmtocpva-solidblack.xml: Added option "-solidblack"
	  to "ppmtocpva" driver, it is new in the version 1.0 of the driver.

	* db/source/printer/168201.xml: Corrected the resolution of the
	  Citizen Printiva 600C.

	* db/source/driver/ppmtocpva.xml: Added the old Alps MD models to
	  the printers supported by the "ppmtocpva" driver.

2001-08-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-cleanupdrivers: Removes all driver entries without
	  command line (<prototype>..</prototype>) from a local Foomatic
	  database. So frontends do not display "unusable" printer/driver
	  combos.

	* foomatic-preferred-drivers: Simple program which adds a
	  <driver>..</driver> entry to every printer. The best driver is
	  determined by a ranking. When one deletes all XML files for
	  drivers which are not available on the system (and adds XML files
	  for additional drivers) all printers will have the best driver
	  of the current system as preferred driver.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Exported "get_overview" for
	  foomatic-preferred-drivers.

	* db/source/*/*: Added the newest inkjets of Epson and the newest
	  lasers of HP: Epson Stylus C20, C40, Epson Stylus Photo 785,
	  875, 895, Epson Stylus Pro 10000, HP LaserJet 1200, 1220, 2200,
	  3200m, 4100, 8150, 9000, HP Color LaserJet 4550.

	* db/source/*/*: Corrected driver list for the HP LaserJet 3200se,
	  it is the same as for the HP LaserJet 3200 now.

	* db/source/driver/bjc600.xml: Removed the Canon BJC-5000 from the
	  list of supported printers, it is a paperweight for sure.

	* db/source/printer/474354.xml: Removed this extra entry for the
	  Canon BJC-85. It was a relict of the time when the database was
	  publicly editable.

2001-07-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Take preferred driver (<driver>..</driver>
	  tag) into thw overview listing (overview.xml, foomatic-configure
	  -O).

	* db/source/opt/69.xml: Made the "Normal" quality with the "cdj880"
	  driver available again for all printers. With GNU GhostScript
	  6.51 it works without problems.
	
2001-07-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>
	
	* foomatic-configure: When one uses the -P option with a printer
	  and a driver to obtain the datablob of this combo, one can also
	  supply a queue to apply the default options of that queue to the
	  datablob of the chosen combo. This can be used when one wants to
	  change the driver used for a queue with the help of a
	  frontend. The obtained datablob can be used to generate the
	  option dialog in this situation.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: The option and choice value arrays are
	  sorted now (by a standard option list, by the "normalizename"
	  function which is already used for printer names on the web
	  site, and alphabatically/case-insensitive), so in XPDQ, KUPS,
	  QtCUPS, XPP, the upcoming new printerdrake (Mandrake 8.1), and
	  other frontends the options and choices will appear sorted.

2001-07-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added the possibility to copy/clone queues,
	  now queues can be transferred to another spooler conserving all
	  settings, including the default option settings. Restructured
	  all queue query functions, now they can also generate complete
	  Perl datablobs with all option default settings (even settings
	  which XPDQ has written into /etc/pdq/printrc or which KUPS has
	  written into the PPD files) and all queue settings as the
	  connection URI, description, location, ... (in the new
	  'queuedata' field). This facility can be used by graphical
	  frontends. Now foomatic-configure also supports to be called
	  unser different names and to load the default spooler choice
	  from a file.

2001-07-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Restructured all queue setup functions, now
	  it is possible with all the spoolers to modify queues by only
	  supplying the items which are changed on the foomatic-configure
	  command line. One can even delete the description or location
	  entries or switch from a queue with driver to a raw
	  queue. Default settings for options do not get lost when one
	  changes the driver and the new driver has options with the same
	  name. Also option settings done with the "native" tools of CUPS
	  and PDQ do not get lost on any kind of manipulation done with
	  foomatic-configure. Extra Perl datablob files removed to avoid
	  problems with maintaining redundant data repositories. Datablobs
	  are now in the main config files (they were already there for
	  CUPS and LPD/LPRng, for PDQ they are addad now. Output of
	  datablobs for frontends will be done by a special command line
	  option. The query functions are cleaned up now.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Added Perl datablob to the PDQ datafiles,
	  added a line break to the end of all "die" and "warn" messages
	  to clean the error message output.

2001-07-19  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Fixed command line option translation when
	  printing with PDQ (numerical options).

	* foomatic-configure: XML-Combo data in /etc/foomatic is gzipped
	  now (compression factor 10), Perl datablobs with the
	  user-supplied default option settings are stored in
	  /etc/foomatic, too (gzip factor 8). They serve for frontends to
	  get the available options and make it easier to transfer the
	  queues without loss of option settings.
	  Setup function for LPD/LPRng restructured, it allows modifying a
	  queue only supplying the information which changes on the
	  foomatic-configure command line. One can even change the driver
	  and all default settings of options with the same name in the
	  old and the new driver are conserved.

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed help page of PDQ (numerical options).
	
2001-07-18  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Links named "lp", "lpr", "lpq", "lprm", and
	  "lpc" to the foomatic-printjob executable can be made and the
	  program does the action of the appropriate command when called
	  through one of the links, job list ("lpq") output of LPRng
	  filtered so that it comes out in the same form as the job
	  listings of the other spoolers, possibility to save a default
	  spooler.
	
2001-07-17  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Added all missing job listing and job removal
	  functions. Added functionality for advanced queue and job
	  control. Updated help message.

	* Makefile: Added CUPS commands for queue and job control.

	* makeDefaults: Added CUPS commands for queue and job control.
	
2001-07-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Added job listing (query) and job removal
	  functions for PDQ. Added job listing function for LPD. Added
	  line breaks at the end of all "die" calls so that the line
	  number is not shown when the program executes the appropriate
	  "die",

	* foomatic-configure: Added line breaks at the end of all "die"
	  calls.
	
2001-07-15  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Coomand line options which are not used by
	  foomatic-printjob are passed to spooler-specific printing
	  command, Support for printing multiple copies with PDQ, printer
	  queue can also be specified with the "-d" option.
	
2001-07-14  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-printjob: Exit status of the spooler's printing command
	  is passed back to the user as the exit status of
	  foomatic-printjob, GNU-lpr (VA-Linux) is auto-detected and the
	  options are passed appropriately. Clean-up of the help message
	  (option -h).

	* foomatic-configure: Support for setting default options, help
	  message cleaned up.
	
2001-07-13  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Removed backquote from the boolean option
	  example in the PDQ help page. It broke the shell script for
	  printing the page. Preliminary fix for foomatic-configure not
	  exiting when building combo data with the Gimp-Print Foomatic
	  data installed: Flushing memory cache during build after
	  treatment of every option.

	* foomatic-printjob: Fixed option handling,

	* foomatic-configure: Set automatically a search path to
	  /etc/foomatic/pdq into the /usr/lib/pdq/printrc file, so that
	  the Foomatic driver description files are found.
	
2001-07-11  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: The INSTALLPREFIX facility was broken. Fixed.

	* USAGE: Added user instructions.

	* README: Pointed to new USAGE file
	
2001-07-05  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* sharp.upp: New driver for the Sharp AJ-1800/2000 inkjet printers
	
2001-07-02  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefile: Added foomatic-printjob to the user programs to be
	  installed
	
2001-07-01  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Now the combo XML data and not only the
	  printer data is stored in /etc/foomatic for every queue, the
	  "-X" option allows also getting combo data by supplying both a
	  printer and a driver, the logfile for the LPD/LPRng queues,
	  /var/log/lp-errs is touched now when a queue is added, so that
	  it is made sure that it exists.

	* foomatic-printjob, Makefile, makeDefaults: First sketch of
	  foomatic-printjob: Now one has basic printing functionality with
	  options on all spoolers.

2001-06-30  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure, Makefile, makeDefaults: PDQ support added:
	  Now we have a command-line-based administration interface for
	  PDQ and the basic functionality of foomatic-configure is
	  completed. Fixed bug in help message of foomatic-configure. In
	  LPD "rlpr" is only used for remote LPD queues with filter, for
	  raw queues the "rm" and "rp" tags in the /etc/printcap file are
	  used.
	
2001-06-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Added LPRng support (without
	  magicfilter). The support is done by adding the differences
	  between LPD and LPRng in the functions for handling LPD. Fixed
	  autodetection of LPRng (typo).
2001-06-29  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lpdomatic: Fixed: The documentation page did not show the
	  correct lpr command line example for LPRng and when lpdomatic
	  does not find the printer driver description file (*.lom) it did
	  not put the file name into the error message.

	* Makefile: Removed comment that LPRng is not supported yet.
	
2001-06-28  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* lib/Foomatic/DB.pm: Fixed several bugs in the function
	  getpdqdata(): PostScript/PJL options were not prepended to the
	  job data/the GhostScript output, let the choice names be
	  <option>_<choice> and not only <choice>, because in PDQ one
	  provides only the choice name and not the option name and the
	  choice name on the command line. So options with the same choice
	  names (as "Duplex" and "Manualfeed" on the LaserJet 4050 with
	  "ljet4" driver, which have both "On" and "Off" as choices) are
	  ambiguous, added "docs" option to print documentation page with
	  PDQ, fixed boolean options, they were broken. Text file printout
	  done with "mpage" now.

	* cupsomatic, lpdomatic: Fixed bug of "This option corresponds to
	  a PJL command" not appearing on documentation page (option
	  "docs").
	
2001-06-27  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Query function for CUPS, corrected bug in
	  function dump_config where the <queue ...> tag was closed by
	  </foomatic>, fixed query function for LPD, so that it supports
	  all backend types, remote LPD printing under LPD done with
	  "rlpr".

	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Added /etc/cups/printers.conf.
	
2001-06-26  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for adding/modifying and removing
	  CUPS queues (for all backends supported by CUPS).
	
	* cupsomatic: Parsing of options embedded in the document
	  fixed. For accessing the value of an enumerated option $avalue
	  instead of $value was used, so the values read into $value were
	  not inserted into the option list. Search the first 1000 lines
	  for options because after polling the PJL options from a printer
	  or with a PostScript printer with many features in its PPD file
	  the 100 lines can easily be exceeded.

	* lpdomatic/cupsomatic (common part): The support of PJL option is
	  marked by the existence of the "pjl" key in the Perl data set of
	  the printer/driver combo. So "if (defined($dat->{'pjl'}))" and
	  not "if ($dat->{'pjl'})" has to be asked to check PJL support.
	
2001-06-25  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Support for adding CUPS queues (all queue
	  types supported by "lpadmin"). Bugfixes in queue setup for LPD:
	  Make directories before the backend script for raw queues is
	  written to there, Rename old $etcfile and $etcxfile also when
	  one sets up a raw queue.
	
	* Makefile, makeDefaults: Set default paths and file names for CUPS,
	  let cupsomatic be installed in the CUPS filter directory.

2001-06-24  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* foomatic-configure: Now one can configure all types of
	  LPD queues automatically: local USB/parallel, remote 
	  LPD/SMB/Socket. In addition one can define a queue which pipes the
	  output into an arbitrary command or a raw queue. Bugfix: Removed
	  colon after "q" (="quiet") in "getopts()" line. Introduced "-f"
	  (="force") flag of foomatic-datafile.

	* lpdomatic (bugfix): In lpdomatic the
	  prepending of PJL options is suppressed for non-PJL printers.

	* Makefile (bugfix): Added foomatic-*pjloptions, moved
	  foomatic-configure to admin programs. Fixed links of the pcache
	  and compiled directories in /var/cache/foomatic to
	  /usr/local/share/foomatic/db, before the printer combo was always
	  recompiled.
	
2001-06-21  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Makefiles: Allowed the possibility to install the Perl libs with
	  another prefix than the rest of the files. So installation is also
	  possible when Perl does not search for libraries in /usr/local.
	
2001-06-20  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* Bugfixes: foomatic-configure could not delete queues, makeDefaults
	  set a wrong path for lpdomatic, Makefile missed a "make" in
	  the process of installing the Perl libraries.
	
2001-06-16  Till Kamppeter <till.kamppeter@gmx.net>

	* PJL options can be added to the Foomatic data now:
	  foomatic-getpjloptions retrives them from the printer,
	  foomatic-addpjloptions generates XML datasets from them.
	
2001-04-01  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Various renaming has happened.  Instead of 'PHTDBPUB', it's
	  Foomatic::DB.  Foomatic::Defaults exports the libdir et al into
	  you, and the flock of companion modules represent other mostly
	  internal code.
 
	* Rearranged all the code; now there's a proper Perl module, in
	  theory at least, in Foomatic/, and the toplevel Makefile
	  supports this.  There's also 'make testing', for a run-in-place
	  setup.

2001-03-14  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Minor updates to reflect website postgres->xml conversion.

2001-03-10  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Added section="??" attribuge to arg_postscript.  Now it's clear
	  where the Postscript snippets should be placed in the document.
	  OTOH, the filters haven't even absorbed Crutcher's DocumentSetup
	  patch, nevermind support for other locations.  And JCL still
	  isn't handled.  Or ppd constraints.  Or queries.  Etc.

	* Fixed Till's bug wrt empty options being left out.  Also fixed a
	  few other subtle bugs in ppd parser and foo option generator.

	* Small updates to Makefile; it might work again.  Note that it
	  modifies the scripts in place before installing, which will
	  cause confusion if you attempt further work in place.

	* Added foomatic-kitload, which imports source data subsets into
	  the local data library.

2001-03-07  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Various additional checks and things when doing combo ops in
	  hopes of avoiding horribly mysterious error messages.

	* Implemented foomatic-ppdload.  It might even work(tm).

2001-03-06  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Made dump_db strip out illegal constraints, and implemented
	  comments filtering.  Only <p> and <a> are allowed now.  <br> is
	  mapped into <p>.

	* New snap of Postgres database

	* Make install should(tm) now do something sensible.  It still
	  ought to autodetect "flavor" for foomatic-configure.

	* Rename make-datafile to foomatic-datafile.

	* Wrap f-c -Q output in <queues> to make it have one toplevel
	  entity.

2001-03-04  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Removed constraints entirely from combo data.  So arg_defval now
	  appears at /option/arg_defval instead of at
	  /option/constraints/constraint/arg_defval.

	* Switch verified tag to an unverified tag.  Eventually, the xml
	  dataset will be defined as containing only verified information,
	  so this way there's one less tag for maintainers to fiddle with.

	* Prepare for CVS integration.

	* Various minor twiddles around the website programs.

	* args_byname twiddle for Till.

	* Include all the backends in the package.
	
2001-02-28  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

        * Require Storable
        
	* Added printer autodetect sections to overview.  Use xpath or
	  similar to see the values in /printer/autodetect/parallel
	
	* -Q in foomatic-configure; prints XML summary of system printer
	  configuration.  -X and -O allow examination of the whole
	  database.  f-c API should now be sufficient to build GUIs atop.

	* compile_db changes to limit pain of Perl memory leaks.

	* Added the pcache, a persistent pre-parsed cache of everything.

	* Various buglets from Till.  Invalid constraints just warn, don't
	  hose the whole option.  Etc.

	* Add foomatic-configure; initial LPD support.

	* Various typos and minor fixes; the overview compile/save was
	  broken, and the overview Perl was missing the driver list.

	* Begin beta3.

2001-02-25  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@linuxprinting.org>

	* Added methods get_makes, get_javascript2, get_models_by_make,
	  get_printer_from_make_model.

	* Added overview support.  Various methods now return or use the
	  overview infromation; the overview is just a summary listing of
	  various database-wide info.  By using it, many operations are
	  less horribly slow.  The overview is db/compiled/overview.xml

	* Don't actually need XML::Grove::PerlSAX.

	* Added -f clag to compile_db, and extra work avoidance code.

	* Fixed variable naming bug in pdq generator, and fixed boolean
	  option conversion in getdat.

2001-02-25  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@habanero.picante.com>

	* Included an experimental dataset from the new data generation
	  code I've written for gimp-print.  The driver "stp-4.1.5" might
	  even work(tm).

2001-02-20  Grant Taylor  <gtaylor@habanero.picante.com>

	* Subtle adjustments to <constraint> contents.	The <sense>
	  element is gone; replaced with the sense="true" or sense="false"
	  attribute on the <constraint> tag itself.  Also, you can now
	  specify a <printer>printer-id</printer> element instead of
	  make/model; this is useful for automatically generated data.
