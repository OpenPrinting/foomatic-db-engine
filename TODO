 - Possibility for users to have their personal default options
   (.lpoptions file as in CUPS, due to the Foomatic options having the same
   names as the CUPS-O-MATIC options one can even use an .lpoptions file
   with exactly the same format as the CUPS file and it will be used by
   both Foomatic and CUPS)

 - Write a few key lint-like and transforming tools for the xml data.

 - Improve ascii support to lpdomatic and pdq files.  ASCII should
   simply be a matter of observing the ascii bit in the printer $dat
   and sending either crlf-ed text or postscriptifying and running
   through the ps driver.  Right now text is always translated to
   PostScript (with the advantage of more nicely-looking text
   output (with head line, page numbers, ...). When one implements
   the possibility to pass text directly to the printer, one should
   consider the optional use or the "pr" filter.
