.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI foomatic-getpjloptions " device"

.BI foomatic-getpjloptions " hostname\ port"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B foomatic-getpjloptions
Sends a set of PJL commands and reads back
the PJL options and status from a printer over a network connection
or device bidirectional interface such as parallel, USB, serial.
printers to standard output. The
output can be piped into foomatic-addpjloptions to add options to the database.


.SS Options
.TP 10
.BI device
The interface to which a local printer is connected, e.g. /dev/lp0, /dev/usb/lp0,
/dev/tty00, etc.
For a parallel port,
you must have bidirectional support enabled at the
BIOS level and the parallel port driver must support the bidirectional mode.
Check your parallel port BIOS settings for  EPP/bi-directional mode.

.TP 10
.BI hostname
Host name or IP address of a network printer (HP JetDirect, DLINK, etc.).

.TP 10
.BI port
Port on which your network printer listens for socket (Appsocket) connections.

Modified by Patrick Powell <papowell at lprng.com> to provide betters
support for network printers, error messages, and remove CR and FF from output.
